“I’ve witnessed him bragging [to staff about] telling Dolly Parton fans they can have a meet-and-greet for a b--- job,” according to a former Webster employee, who worked on Parton’s publicity team for several years. The former employee, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Webster, said Webster also told the then-employee directly that he received oral sex, on multiple occasions, in exchange for the meet-and-greets.

The ex-employee told Fox News that Webster routinely approached fans and asked for sexually explicit images, and told the fans they could meet the 71-year-old country superstar if they complied. The former employee said Webster showed her and other employees the explicit photos he received from fans, after promising to introduce them to Parton. The employee’s boyfriend, who also spoke to Fox News, said she often complained of Webster’s lurid use of Parton’s fame.

The former employee said she does not believe Parton was ever aware of Webster’s behavior.

Another former staffer who worked for Webster told Fox News he also heard the publicist brag about “trading” meet-and-greets and backstage passes for oral sex, as late as Parton’s “most recent touring season.” Parton’s ""Pure and Simple"" tour ran from June 3, 2016 to December 10, 2016.

A third employee echoed the others’ statements and said Webster often spoke of using Parton’s name for sexual favors from fans.

Parton cut ties with Webster’s firm this week, and her face disappeared from the front page of the company website on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if she had acquired a new publicist. Her manager and record label did not return repeated requests for comment about Webster allegedly using her name in exchange for sexual favors.

Parton released a note about Webster late Thursday via Twitter, which some fans criticized as not critical enough of the publicist. ""I've worked with Kirt Webster for many years, and he has done a wonderful job. I am hoping that the accusations are not true,"" she wrote.

Over the weekend, apparel company Alpha Industries launched an antifa-influenced M-65 Anarchy Cotton-Blend Field Jacket on high-end retailer Barneys' website.

WHY IVANKA TRUMP IS A ROLE MODEL — AND FASHION ICON — IN JAPAN

The olive green jacket, which is posed with designer distressed jeans and Doc Marten boots – a symbol of punk fashion – features a bold “Revolution” printed across the front, along with a sloppy anarchy symbol and other ""edgy"" phrases and quips.

Angelyn Fernandez, VP of Product at Alpha Industries, said in an e-mailed statement to the Daily Dot, “We have seen resistance to power and authority become a trend in our current pop culture and society, often expressed through fashion,” she said.

However, that attempt to capitalize on the pop culture “trend” of resistance to power is what has many outraged on Twitter. Some have questioned if the jacket is fake because of its bizarrely high-price tag (members of the antifa movement are usually against capitalism) and over-the-top look.

The commercialized jacket tries very hard to look authentically anarchist, while also costing nearly $400 and being mass-produced, but is not winning any fans.

Alpha Industries, which “started as a contractor for the U.S. Military,” said in a statement to Fox News, “Since 1965, the M65 field jackets have been a favored method to graphically express one’s opinion.”

“Alpha developed the Barneys M65 anarchy jacket to encompass the artistic and graphic expressions of individuality. Self-expression often inspires fashion, and fashion inspires self expression. Alpha Industries recognizes that the M65 field jacket has and will remain a canvas for all manner of self expression,” the statement continues.

People on Twitter aren't buying the ""self-expression"" angle. One user is even claiming this is an attempt to silence anti-facism members by making them “trendy.” While another is calling for a complete boycott of Barneys, who is selling the jacket.

Other Twitter users argue, however, that the coat will be purchased by ""ANTIFA cowards"" and ""privileged Millennials.""

The open sniping between President Trump and the Bush family comes at the same time that veteran Democratic insider Donna Brazille is revealing her doubts about Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and the process by which she beat Bernie Sanders.

It’s not a mere coincidence. The dynasties at the top of the two major parties for the past quarter-century are under attack from within as never before. Trump ran as a rejection especially of George W. Bush in the 2016 Republican primaries and used Jeb Bush as a foil during the debates, riding that anti-establishment wave all the way to the White House.

Hillary Clinton was able to beat back a surprisingly strong primary challenge from Sanders, the septuagenarian socialist senator from Vermont who had never even appeared on the ballot as a Democrat before. But Sanders was running against Bill Clinton’s centrist Democratic Leadership Council legacy as much as his was a protest candidacy against Hillary.

Both outcomes have been second-guessed. Hillary’s defeat at the hands of Trump has some Democrats quietly questioning whether Sanders was right all along, even as they cheer her not-so-cathartic book tour. Republicans (and more than a few liberals) have begun to miss the virtues of both Presidents Bush after prolonged exposure to Trump’s vices.

Nevertheless, the underlying political conditions in both parties appear to be moving against the Bushes and Clintons. Look no further than Virginia, where no less of a Bush Republican than Ed Gillespie has taken a page out of Trump’s playbook to run a hard-nosed campaign in which culture war issues have been more prominent than his preferred technocratic policy solutions (though one could argue his campaign ads are also reminiscent of the work the late Lee Atwater did for George H.W. Bush).",The Clinton and Bush Dynasties Face Challenges from Inside Their Own Parties,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/clinton-and-bush-dynasties-face-challenges-inside-their-own-parties#commenting

There is no doubt the crown prince is devoted to a liberalized role for religion and the rights of women.
In pushing his reforms the crown prince is making a demographic bet.","Recent events in Saudi Arabia confirm the long-held view that very little in the Middle East is easily understood.

A day after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched a palace purge by arresting several of his fellow royals, a high-ranking prince mysteriously died in a helicopter crash. State media did not reveal the cause of the crash, albeit any suggestion of motive would be entirely speculative.

There are conditions that have been established. Dozens of princes, ministers and a billionaire tycoon have been arrested as bin Salman, 32, attempts to consolidate his power. It would appear as if the crown prince wants to eliminate any trace of dissent prior to the formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father, who is suffering from a terminal illness.

One of those detained by authorities is Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an investor who owns a major stake in Twitter, Citigroup and News America. He has also contributed to Middle East Studies programs at universities, including Columbia and Yale. His arrest suggests no one is beyond the reach of the crown prince.

Over the last two years bin Salman has taken over most of the key economic and security posts and is unquestionably the most important figure in government. The crown prince is also deputy prime minister (the king is prime minister) and minister of defense.

Clearly, bin Salman’s seizure of power has given rise to the resistance inside and outside the royal family. In the Saudi system, power has been passed among the sons of the founder of the modern Saudi kingdom, Ibn Saud. Bin Salman is putting an end to all of that, as his branch of the family consolidates political power and all military authority.

The question that emerges from these actions remains unclear. One theory is predicated on a failed coup attempt that bin Salman discovered and crushed. Another theory contends that the crown prince prefers to act now, while his father is king and can lend legitimacy to his son’s actions. Yet another view is the crown prince, having announced ambitious social and economic changes, wants to act quickly to avoid blowback.

There is no doubt the crown prince is devoted to a liberalized role for religion and the rights of women. He has proposed that women be allowed to drive and mix with men in sports stadiums. He is selling off a part of the kingdom’s key asset – state-owned oil and natural company Saudi Aramco.

In addition, bin Salman has stood up to fundamentalist Wahhabi clerics opposed to his program. But he has also made it clear that he will not tolerate political opposition from commoners or members of the royal family. In his case, it is “my way or the highway.”

Dozens of hard-line clerics have spoken out and been detained. Other have been designated to speak publicly about respect for other religions, a topic once anathema to the kingdom’s religious superstructure.

Most clerics oppose bin Salman, if recent reports can be relied on, but preserving the alliance with the monarchy is what matters most. They have much more to lose by protesting than biting their tongues.

In pushing his reforms the crown prince is making a demographic bet. The kingdom’s large population of young people cares more about entertainment and economic opportunities than religious dogma. Serious measures to stamp out the rigidities of Islamic fundamentalism that permeate the nation could have salutary effects on trade and financial transactions.

Yet one cannot overlook events in 1979, when extremists accused the royal family of being insufficiently Islamic and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca. That event shocked the Muslim world and compromised the position of the royal family.

That explains why tension resides over the Riyadh sky. It is a tension borne of rapid change and coping with uncertainty. However, the crown prince is resourceful and clever. Whether he has the stamina to maintain his revolutionary stance remains to be seen.",Saudi Arabia's future: The crown prince makes a demographic bet,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/saudi-arabias-future-crown-prince-makes-demographic-bet.html

El Moussa: I’m going to continue spreading the word about cancer.","Tarek El Moussa has fought many battles over the years.

The 36-year-old star of HGTV’s popular house-flipping series “Flip or Flop” has faced both thyroid and testicular cancer in 2013 after a fan noticed a lump on his neck and reached out to his show’s producers.

The viewer, who happened to be a nurse, warned El Moussa he might have cancer and should consider getting examined. The popular television personality received a diagnosis, which resulted in the removal of a malignant tumor. But just weeks later, El Moussa was diagnosed with testicular cancer.

El Moussa has since beat his cancers and is now determined to save lives. He’s teamed up with the Movember Foundation to raise awareness about men’s health, as well as encourage early cancer detection.

Fox News spoke to El Moussa about his public health ordeal and how lives can be saved:

Fox News: What was going through your mind when you realized you were going to be battling cancer again?

Tarek El Moussa: Well, actually it wasn’t again. It was at the same time! I’ll never forget the day when I found out I was also diagnosed with testicular cancer. The first thing I thought was I’m going to die and what is my family going to do? That’s how I dealt with it, but you know, the next day, I woke up and felt better and I tried to stay positive. I was just prepared to move forward and do whatever it is I needed to do to fight them and beat them.

Fox News: Testicular cancer is more private and personal in nature. Why did you choose to open up to fans?

El Moussa: I was very open with the thyroid cancer. I got a lot of messages through Instagram and Facebook where people were telling me that because of my story, they found out they had cancer because they got checked. So I may have saved some lives. And then my stepfather got diagnosed with testicular cancer, which obviously hit very close to home. When that happened, I thought it would be a good idea to create exposure, share my story and help save some lives.

Fox News: How did battling cancer twice change your life?

El Moussa: Obviously, I look at things a little bit differently, you know. Obviously, before the kids were the most important thing. But now, the only thing that matters are my children, being healthy, and being the best dad possible. Taking a set back from work, taking better care of myself, eating healthy, taking vitamins, taking more cardio exercises, hot yoga, things like that.

Fox News: Tell us about this movement happening this month.

El Moussa: The Movember Foundation is obviously really, really cool. They promote Movember, which is when you grow a moustache to raise awareness on men’s health, but not everybody can grow moustaches! So there’s the MOVE campaign, which tells people to get out there and move. Get out there, improve your health and be as healthy as possible.

Fox News: Will you be growing one this year?

El Moussa: Unfortunately, I can’t due to my show filming. Although I would love to, I just don’t have that capability. But I will be exercising!

Fox News: How important has it been for you to reach out to fans like that nurse did for you?

El Moussa: You know, it’s very, very important. A lot of people have told me that my story has encouraged them to get checked. Some of them didn’t even know they had cancer. The further along it goes, the worst stage you’re in. So, if I was able to help people catch it in early than that might have saved their lives.

Fox News: Have you stayed in touch with her?

El Moussa: Yeah, we’ve definitely talked in person. We’ve met in person a few times. And every now and then we do check in. I remember when I went through my surgery, I was actually texting her back and forth in my hospital. She’s a very, very special person to me. I’m very lucky.

Fox News: How did she find you?

El Moussa: It wasn’t even social media... She was watching the show in Texas. She emailed my production company. Then they sent me an email. The gist of it was I’m sure if this is a joke or not, but we’re going to send this to you anyway. And it turned out she was right.

Fox News: How has your lifestyle changed since battling cancer?

El Moussa: My exercise before just used to be weight-lifting. I’ve changed my exercise to be more cardio-based, which in result has lowered my heart rate, lowered my blood pressure, and it’s improved my overall health. On top of that, I try to eat very healthy. I take a lot of vitamins and just focus on myself and what’s best for me.

Fox News: How are your children?

El Moussa: They’re doing great! They’re growing so fast. My daughter, she just turned seven. It’s just been amazing to watch how they transform every single day. They say one day you open your eyes and they’re 18. One day I opened my eyes and she’s 7… it’s exciting. I just spend so much time with her. I’m trying to expose her to so many different things, like dirt biking. We go to the lake, we go surfing. We’re just having a blast and I can’t wait to do that with my son.

Fox News: We hear you're working on Season 7 of “Flip or Flop.” What should fans expect?

El Moussa: We’re... probably going to be airing early spring or summer of next year. But you know, we definitely have a good season. We’re doing a lot of different styles of houses. We are going a bit further with design. We’re getting cooler designs. On each property, we’re picking one specific thing that will really stand out. It’s still the same show, but it’s a little more design-based. It’s been a lot of fun filming it.

Fox News: As a public figure, how do you find that balance of keeping your personal life private?

El Moussa: I really don’t get to keep a private life. For me, I’m just a guy who lives a normal life. I go work with my friends; I film my show; I come home; I hang out with my buddies; I go golfing; I go dirt biking, so for me I just live my life.

Fox News: How are you doing these days?

El Moussa: I’m doing great. I lowered my heart rate, I lowered my blood pressure, my cardio is better. Overall, I’m feeling great. It’s the best I’ve ever felt.

Fox News: What’s next for you?

El Moussa: I’m going to continue spreading the word about cancer. People need to get checked. People need to take care of themselves. I’m working on a book. I love public speaking so I’m looking to do more motivational speaking where I can share my story about my health issues, as well as the financial ups and downs I’ve gone through.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says he has directed the Pentagon's watchdog to examine the circumstances of the Air Force's failure to report the Texas church shooter's domestic violence conviction to the FBI.

Mattis says we have to ""find out what's going on.""

Under Pentagon rules, convictions of military personnel in crimes like assault should be shared with the FBI for its National Criminal Information Center database. Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman in Sunday's attack, was convicted of assault against his wife and stepson in an Air Force court-martial in 2012.

Mattis says: ""If the problem is we didn't put something out, we'll correct that.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan says he has questions for the Air Force about how the gunman who killed 26 people at a Texas church obtained a gun.

Devin Patrick Kelley had a history of domestic violence but was able to buy weapons because the Air Force did not submit his criminal history to the FBI as required by military rules.

Ryan on Tuesday echoed other lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — who want to know why there was a breakdown in the system that allowed Kelley to legally purchase a weapon.

Ryan told reporters at a weekly news conference on Tuesday that he wants to know how Kelley slipped through the cracks.

Pope Francis has sent a telegram to the archbishop of San Antonio expressing his condolences for the deadly shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs.

The telegram was sent Tuesday by the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who said the pope was ""deeply grieved by news of the loss of life and grave injuries caused by the act of senseless violence.""

At least 26 people died in the shooting on Sunday.

The pontiff sent condolences to ""the families of the victims and the wounded, to the members of the congregation and the entire local community.""

Francis also offered prayers ""to console all who mourn and to grant them the spiritual strength that triumphs over violence and hatred by the power of forgiveness, hope and reconciling love.""

A Texas couple who attended Sunday's service where 26 worshippers were fatally shot says the gunman appeared to target babies who cried and others who screamed or made noise.

Roseanne Solis and her husband Joaquin Ramirez told KSAT-TV in San Antonio on Monday that people fell to the ground after the man sprayed gunfire from outside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs.

Authorities have identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.

Solis says there was a moment of silence before Kelley yelled, ""Everybody die!"" and then another round of gunfire began.

She says her brother was a retired railroad worker who was often the center of attention.

President Donald Trump says stricter gun control measures might have led to additional casualties during a mass shooting at a South Texas church.

Trump said at a Tuesday news conference in South Korea that, ""If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happens to have a gun or a rifle in his trunk.""

He had been asked whether he would support ""extreme vetting"" for gun purchases similar to the ""extreme vetting"" he's called for of people entering the country.

Trump says if that a neighboring good Samaritan hadn't had a gun, ""instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.""

In 2014, Kelley was formally ousted from the Air Force for a 2012 assault on his ex-wife in which he choked her and struck her son hard enough to fracture his skull.

Listen here for the full interview:

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And, joining us right now it's our privilege to bring the vice president of the United States. If there's somebody more respect on our Capital Hill or by the president I don't know who it is. Mr. Vice President, welcome back.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Brian, it's great to be on the program and congratulations on your book. I can't wait to get through it.

KILMEADE: Thank you very much and I'll definitely get it to you if you're allowed - I can never know what the rules are with politicians. If I can actually send it to you or not. I don't want to get you in trouble.

PENCE: Don't worry, I'll get one on my own. I've read a biography in the past of Andrew Jackson but I'm really looking forward to reading yours.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much. Mr. Vice President, I tell you I know you're as strong on terror as anyone when you were in Congress let alone now. Have we - have your policy now mirroring President Obama's policy of going through the legal system instead of putting him through the military system?

PENCE: Look, well first off let me - let me say as the president has said that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York City. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear to support the efforts of the New York City Police Department to follow through on the investigation.

And, we're going to hold this assailant responsible and if there are any more involved we're going to hold them to the very strictest account. This was a barbaric act of terrorism and it will not stand. And, it is in a very real sense, Brian, we believe, of indication of aggressive posture President Trump has taken in taking the fight to ISIS on their soil on our terms.

As you reported very well on this radio program and on the airwaves of Fox and Friends as we speak thanks to U.S. Armed Forces and our allies ISIS is on the run. We have overtaken the so-called capital of their caliphate Raqqa. There's more fighting to be done but Tuesday was a grim reminder --

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: ... that our enemies are still - are still afoot. They're still inspiring violence that threatens our people and I can assure you President Trump and our entire administration, our Armed Forces will not rest, we will not relent until we destroy ISIS at its sore so it can no longer inspire or make possible these kinds of acts of violence.

KILMEADE: But, Mr. Vice President, he said -

PENCE: I would say that very clearly. But so there's nothing - I got to tell you there's nothing about President Trump's policies that mirror the last administration. I mean, ISIS came to life, was literally conjured out of the - out of the desert policies of the last administration -

KILMEADE: But they brought the battle here, Mr. Vice President and we're not treated like that.

PENCE: Well, they did.

KILMEADE: He's a - he say's he's a soldier of the caliphate. As Senator Lindsey Graham said, ""Why are we treating him like a criminal?"" Here is Ed Davis. He said the way the Boston bombers were treated he said this is the call he got after they got the Zarnia brother. The other one was dead. Cut 24.

ED DAVIS: There's a clause in the Patriot Act that takes the process out of the civilian courts into a military style process. So, in the case of (inaudible) I got a call from the United States Attorney who ordered me to give orders to my officers not to read the suspect their rights.

And, they brought a special team in of intelligence and military personnel because they thought that this may be an ongoing plot. So, there is - there is a possibility of doing that in the law.

KILMEADE: Why didn't we do that? This guy - yes go ahead.

PENCE: Well, Brian, the president made it clear that he was open to sending this assailant, this terrorist to Guantanamo. In fact I think he - the president tweeted this morning that he would have loved to send the New York terrorist to Guantanamo but the process takes longer and justice delayed is justice denied.

KILMEADE: But we Mirandize him. He's got a lawyer. Why did we -

PENCE: We want to see - we want to see - and the president has made it clear he believe this is a case where death penalty is warranted, I agree with that in the strongest possible terms. I mean running down innocent civilians, killing eight, injuring more than 11. This was a barbaric terrorist attack and we want to bring this person - we want to bring this person to justice as swiftly as possible. And, that's what informed the president's decision.

KILMEADE: Right. It's just that I want to question more (ph).

PENCE: I really want to take issue, Brian. I mean the truth is as I began to say moments ago, literally the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq created the vacuum in which ISIS was created -

KILMEADE: Oh, I hear you.

PENCE: Literally overran more than half of Iraq. President Trump came into office and he said we are going to destroy ISIS, we're going to - we're going to allow our military to take the action there, take the fight to terrorists and if anything this vicious terrorist attack in New York is simply a confirmation that in President Trump we have the right leadership.

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: We have the right commander-in-chief who's taking the fight to the enemy.

KILMEADE: I just hope - I hope next time we get them, we don't Mirandized him. We hold onto him until our interrogators are - feel as though they understand what - who he's talked to and what he's capable of. I don't think, as much as I respect New York, I don't think they know everything he knows.

And, they - now has a lawyer and he's smiling with an ISIS flag and he's going to start using our legal system. Even though I know he's going to get convicted and maybe killed, I want to know what he knows and I'm not convinced we can do that now. Are you?

PENCE: Well, let me be - let me be - let me be very clear with all of your millions of listeners around the country, we are going to get to the bottom of this terrorist action, who inspired him, who worked with him. There are - there is an aggressive investigation underway. I was briefed again on it this morning.

I was at the CIA yesterday. As I said, your listeners should be confident. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of New York law enforcement. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to hold him to the strictest and swiftest account and justice.

And, we're going to find if there were any others involved and I can't really speak at this moment about that, if there were any other involved, we will hold them to the strictest account. We're going to bring justice to these people. That's how we protect the American people.

KILMEADE: I want to talk about tax reform, I know you do, too. You're going to - later on you're going to be with Governor Scott in Florida but I also know that you have a - the House is finally ready to unveil tax reform. Can you let our listeners know what we - the takeaways?

PENCE: Well, it's been more than a generation since we've - we've passed the kind of tax cuts and tax reform to really liven the American economy. I mean, john F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan did it, and what really begins today in the House of Representatives, and we believe will - will be completed before the end of this year is going to be a historic tax cut that's going to building on the momentum that we already see in this economy, Brian, it really is remarkable. After eight years, of less than 2 percent economic growth, we just posted the second quarter in a row of over 3 percent growth because of the policies President Trump's been advancing in terms of rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy.

But this tax cut plan, will reduce taxes on individuals, it'll simplify the tax code and it'll lower business taxes in America like the business I'm visiting in Florida, to make it possible for American companies to compete with companies around the world. It is - it is remarkable to think that in the most powerful economy on earth, we have one of the highest business tax rates on the planet.

President Trump is committed to change that, bringing middle class tax relief to working families to simplify the tax code, and the great news for the America people is that all starts today with the introduction of the House tax cut bill.

KILMEADE: Some specifics, if I can. The 20 percent the president spoke about, is that a red line, and is it true that you're considering a phase in of it, a gradual decrease?

PENCE: Well, I think the president - I think the president's made it very clear to members of Congress that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent is absolutely imperative. That puts us in a competitive position, the president - we were talking about going to 15 percent early on, the president made it clear we'll do 20, that's it.

So, people - people, I think, understand hoe firmly the president is committed to that. But the other part of this, don't forget, I grew up in a small business family. My family was in the gas station business, Brian, and - and my family, like - like literally millions of business around the country - my - my folks filed their taxes as individuals, that was business income. And we're going to make sure that we also lower the taxes on people that are reporting large incomes that are business income, we're going to lower that to 25 percent.

I mean, if you look back at 1980's, the majority of jobs that were created, the last time we - we passed historic tax relief, were created in small business America. I'm just saying (ph), 20 percent on big corporations, so called, C-corporations, but we're going to go to 25 percent on - on so called past through small businesses. And - and the combination of this, we - we think - we think the combination of this, it's going to be hard to calculate how - how much the American economy is - is - is going to rally around the tax cuts that we're going to fight to get on the president's desk before Christmas.

KILMEADE: Right, and I know you've got to run, you've got to do another interview, but I understand, Steve Scalise told us today, that it's going - the top bracket is going to stay at 39.5 percent. Would you actually say that too?

PENCE: Well, we'll - I know the House of representatives is going to be unveiling heir plan today, President Trump has made it clear that he wants to focus this tax relief on middle class Americans and on job creators and businesses across this country. And we think that what House Republicans unveil today is a great start in that direction, we're grateful for the leadership of Speaker Ryan, of Chairman Kevin Brady and all those that have been working tirelessly with the administration. The Senate will be moving very quickly on their version of the bill and in the weeks ahead, we're literally going to fight everyday to give the American people the kind of tax cuts and tax reform that will make the American economy great again.

KILMEADE: Mr. Vice President, thanks so much for putting us on your schedule, always appreciate it and you say they're going to get it done before the year's end, that will make a lot of people happy. Thanks so much.

Stephen Willeford, 55, said he was at his Sutherland Springs home Sunday when his daughter alerted him that she'd heard gunfire at the First Baptist Church nearby. Willeford said he immediately retrieved his rifle from his weapon safe.

""I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots — just 'Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!' — and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren't just random shots,"" Willeford said Monday during an interview with television stations KHBS/KHOG in Fort Smith and Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Willeford said he loaded his magazine and ran barefoot across the street to the church where he saw gunman Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, and exchanged gunfire.

""He saw me and I saw him,"" Willeford said. ""I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover. I know I hit him. He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.""

As Kelley sped away, Willeford said he ran to a pickup truck stopped an intersection and told the driver, ""That guy just shot up the Baptist church. We need to stop him.""

The driver, Johnnie Langendorff, said he had been driving to Sutherland Springs on Sunday to pick up his girlfriend when a man who'd been exchanging gunfire with Kelley suddenly landed inside his truck.

""He jumped in my truck and said, 'He just shot up the church, we need to go get him.' And I said, 'Let's go,'"" Langendorff, a 27-year-old Seguin resident, told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that the ensuing pursuit eventually clocked speeds upwards of 90 mph (145 kph).

Willeford said he and Langendorrf kept a 911 operator advised as the high-speed pursuit continued. He said Kelley ultimately hit a road sign and flipped his vehicle into a roadside ditch.

Willeford said he then exited Langendorrf's pickup, perched his rifle on the rooftop and trained it on Kelley's vehicle. He then yelled: ""Get out of the truck! Get out of the truck!"" But Kelley did not move.

Langendorff said police arrived about five minutes later. Based on evidence at the scene, investigators believe Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""There was no thinking about it,"" Langendorff said. ""There was just doing. That was the key to all this. Act now. Ask questions later.""

Asked if he felt like a hero, Langendorff said: ""I don't really know how I feel. I just hope that the families and people affected by this can sleep easier knowing that this man is not breathing anymore and not able to hurt anyone else. I feel I just did what was right.""

Though he did not identify Willeford by name, Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said at a news conference Monday that the armed resident who confronted Kelley was toting an ""AR assault rifle and engaged"" the shooter.

Martin later praised Willeford and Langendorff: ""The number one goal of law enforcement is to neutralize the shooter. In this situation, we had two good Samaritans who did that for law enforcement.""

Julius Kepper, Willeford's next-door neighbor for the past seven years, described Willeford as a gun and motorcycle enthusiast who regularly takes target practice at property out in the country, and has as many as five Harley Davidson motorcycles.

""Avid gun collector, a good guy,"" Kepper said.

Kepper and other neighbors said Willeford's family has been in the Sutherland Springs area for at least three generations, including a father and grandfather who were in dairy farming. Stephen Willeford is married with two grown children and works as a plumber who installs lines on major projects such as hospitals, Kepper said.

He called Willeford a ""free spirit"" sort who loves motorcycles despite losing both parents to a motorcycle crash when he was a young adult. ""It was almost the same spot where they ran (the shooter) off the road,"" Kepper said.

Kepper said he's not surprised Willeford would exchange gunfire with the church gunman. Others in the neighborhood would have done the same if they knew what was happening, he said.

""Just like everybody else around here. He was just the first one there,"" Kepper said.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday praised Willeford's actions, after talking to law enforcement officials and visiting the church in Sutherland Springs. He lauded the ""ordinary citizen"" who engaged the gunman.

""One individual demonstrated bravery and courage. We need to be celebrating that bravery and courage,"" Cruz said.

Still, Willeford proved a reluctant hero.

""I didn't want this and I want the focus to be on my friends,"" Willeford told The Dallas Morning News for a story published Monday that also confirmed he was the first person to confront Kelley. ""I have friends in that church. I was terrified while this was going on.""

No one answered the door at the Willeford residence Monday. Food that had been delivered to the house was stacked up on the front porch.

By the end, both daddy and daughter are screaming through the desert in their red sedan as an upbeat song blasts in the background.

Critics, however, weren’t so thrilled with Coke’s timing. While some praised the ad as a celebration of Saudi Arabia’s recent order to overturn its decades-old driving ban on women, others accused Coke of exploiting the historic ruling to turn a profit.

When cameras stopped rolling and millions of viewers weren’t watching, the former football player was at war with himself. While his character personified “sex, drugs and professional wrestling,” DiBiase was a devoted family man of faith.

DiBiase ended his wrestling career in 1999 after 25 years in the industry.

Today, the 63-year-old married father of three is a full-time evangelist who has been officially ordained into the ministry. He is sharing his story in a new documentary, “The Price of Fame,” which premieres in select theaters November 7.

Fox News spoke with the Million Dollar Man, as well as several WWE Superstars, about DiBiase’s religious journey:

Fox News: Who was the Million Dollar Man?

Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man was to professional wrestling what Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. He was like a rich bully. He bullied everybody with his money, and his motto was ""Everybody’s got a price."" The Million Dollar Man thought he could buy anybody or anything and that was the essence of the character. About as evil as you can get!

Fox News: What were some of your memories of the Million Dollar Man?

Christian (Former WWE Superstar): I don’t think that character would have worked with anybody playing it besides Ted DiBiase. I think he just played it to a T, he had the look, the voice, the laugh.

Tommy Dreamer (Former WWE Superstar): I told him [he was] always great. He did everything how you’re supposed to do it. He should have been Mr. Perfect because he did it perfectly.

Christian: He optimized what the Million Dollar Man was and should have been and that’s why it worked.

Fox News: How did this movie come together?

Peter Ferriero (Director): When I started making the movie “The Price of Fame” I initially thought I wanted to find out where all my childhood heroes were. ...Because of his character the Million Dollar Man, he had to actually pay for things and be the Million Dollar Man 24/7.

A post shared by stashpages (@stashpages) on Nov 2, 2017 at 3:51pm PDT

I’ve talked to a lot of guys that he rode with, they all saw his life and the adultery and everything he was doing on the road and that was the beginning of the downfall of Ted DiBiase or the Million Dollar Man, but it was also the start of the rise and the redemption of who he would become.

Fox News: Who is Ted DiBiase today?

DiBiase: Today I am Ted DiBiase, not the wrestler, but now I am a minister. I travel all over the United States basically in evangelism, speaking in churches, speaking in prisons, speaking in rehab centers wherever I can basically sharing my story of redemption and the turnaround in my life.

That’s why this film was titled “The Price of Fame."" Now I want to be careful with saying the price of fame is whatever you make it. We all make individual decisions, but it’s like a lot of the things that come a long with being famous. You got to build accountability into your life or it’s very easy for it to take you down.

A post shared by Ted DiBiase (@mdmteddibiase) on Aug 14, 2017 at 3:32pm PDT

Fox News: What do you hope people will take away from this movie?

Ferriero: I think one of the biggest takeaways I would like for people to have watching the movie is that you can really change your life in a flash. And sometimes forgiveness can not only benefit the person but yourself as well.

DiBiase: The really important things in life, and I found out the hard way because I found all those things at the end of the day to be empty. Because if I don’t have a wife and a family who loves and respects me, if I don’t have their respect and if I’m not living my life in such a way that I’m being open and honest with them than what do I really have.

I’ve been traveling and speaking in churches and all these other places for 17 years now and I’m still going. I tell people all day who say ""When you going to retire?"" I said I never found the word retirement in the bible, so I’m going to keep going till I’m not here.

But there’s also no question that a small subset of Muslims in this country don’t fit the above description, because they support the aims of radical Islamic terrorists.
One thing’s for sure: you won’t find any radical Muslim terrorists who are not Muslims.
Perhaps the Army will next follow suit and appoint civilian monitors to determine where and when it can fight radical Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Perhaps the tool most needed in fighting radical Islamic terrorism today is a strong backbone.","When you’re getting dressed in the morning, you look for a shirt in your closet – not your refrigerator. When you want to go out to dinner, you look for a restaurant – not a dentist’s office. And when you’re a cop looking for radical Islamic terrorists … well, let’s just say you don’t look in a convent, a monastery or a rabbinical seminary.

Is this politically correct? Absolutely not. Is it simple common sense? Of course it is.

There’s no question that the vast majority of Muslims in America are peaceful, law-abiding and hardworking men and women. They serve in our armed forces and police departments, teach in our schools, treat us in hospitals, and work in countless other jobs that benefit our nation. We welcome and appreciate them.

But there’s also no question that a small subset of Muslims in this country don’t fit the above description, because they support the aims of radical Islamic terrorists. And an even smaller, very tiny subset actually engages in terrorism. Finding these people after they commit terrorist acts is challenging. Finding them before they commit terrorist acts and stopping them is incredibly difficult.

A basic principle of police work is that you use logic and common sense when searching for criminals of any kind. You can’t search for everyone everywhere, so you narrow the field of possible suspects. What does the suspected criminal look like – race, sex, height, weight, hair color and style, and so on? Where do you think the suspect might be? These and related questions hold true whether the search is for a robber, a rapist, a drug dealer or a terrorist.

Where might a radical Islamic terrorist be? Well … wild guess … mosques, other areas where Muslims get together, and Muslim neighborhoods. One thing’s for sure: you won’t find any radical Muslim terrorists who are not Muslims.

It does not take a brilliant detective like Dick Tracy or Sherlock Holmes to figure this out. Even the imbecilic film detective Inspector Clouseau could do it.

Yet in New York City last week, where a radical Islamic terrorist drove his truck into innocent people on a bike path on Halloween – killing eight and injuring a dozen – police and other law enforcement officials are being handcuffed. They are being told to ignore their common sense and training, and not focus on Muslims when looking for Muslim terrorists.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said that the Halloween terrorist – indentified by police as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, a Muslim who emigrated from Uzbekistan – was radicalized here in the United States, not in his home country, which has a history of violent Islamic extremists.

If the governor is correct, than where in the U.S. did the radicalization take place? And before we jump to the convenient presumption that Saipov was “self-radicalized” or a “lone wolf,” we should realize by now that terrorists are not hatched overnight after sitting in their basements watching videos.

No one lives in a vacuum. Radicalization is a process that includes both internal and external catalysts and occurs in many environments. That principle was laid out in a report created by the New York City Police Department’s Intelligence Division in 2006 titled “Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat: The NYPD Report,” authored by Mitchell D. Silber and Arvin Bhatt.

The report was a seminal tutorial on how and where the radicalization of “unremarkable” individuals occurred. It was a vital component of the NYPD’s counterterrorism program until 2016.

But last year Mayor Bill de Blasio caved in to demands from the American Civil Liberties Union and several Muslim activist organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, and ordered the counterterrorism report removed from both the NYPD’s website and its training manuals.

And if that was not enough, the mayor also ordered the police to discontinue standard police practices of surveillance and undercover operations of the group most susceptible to radical Islamic terrorists – the Muslim community of the greater New York and New Jersey metropolitan area.

De Blasio’s absurd action came in response to a 2012 lawsuit filed in Newark, New Jersey by Muslim advocates. They claimed that the NYPD was profiling them strictly on the basis of their religion and that they had suffered irreparable damages as a result of police actions.

But U.S. District Judge William J. Martini ruled in 2014 that the NYPD’s investigative practices did not violate the Constitution, nor were any damages suffered by the Muslim community. The plaintiffs appealed the decision and the case was to be reheard. Unfortunately, de Blasio then inexplicably surrendered to the demands of those suing the police department and withdrew from defending the NYPD against the lawsuit.

One of the mosques in New Jersey that claimed to have been unjustly surveilled was the Omar Mosque in Patterson. This is the same mosque attended by Sayfullo Saipov, the now-accused self-proclaimed ISIS follower who struck on Halloween.

Yet NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller stated publicly that the Saipov case has nothing to do with Islam or which mosque someone attended. How quickly he forgets.

Perhaps Miller needs to go back and reread the 2002 book he wrote titled “The Cell: Inside the 9/11 Plot and Why the FBI and CIA Failed to Stop It.” Back then, he clearly acknowledged the obvious fact that that radical Islamic terrorists have connections with Muslim communities.

And as if to add insult to injury, New York City has agreed to an amendment to a court decision that oversees police intelligence investigations of political and religious organizations. De Blasio will now appoint a civilian monitor who will have oversight over who the police department can or cannot investigate.

Perhaps the Army will next follow suit and appoint civilian monitors to determine where and when it can fight radical Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq. That would make as much sense as the de Blasio policy.

Here’s the bottom line: We need to spend less time worrying about being politically correct and more time worrying about how to protect the American people from bloodthirsty radical Islamic terrorists who want to kill and injure as many of us as possible.

At some point, we have to let the police be the police and investigate terrorists and other criminals – regardless of religion, ethnicity or race – based on tried and true procedures.

Good police investigative work in years past resulted in many arrests against criminal organizations like the Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, even though Italians and Colombians were disproportionately represented in these groups. It would have been as silly to search for Mafia kingpins in mosques as it would be to try hunting down ISIS terrorists at Knights of Columbus meetings.

Good police work can be effective against Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda, which often infiltrate the Muslim communities in the United States, only if police are allowed to do their jobs.

Hopefully, the NYPD under the current leadership of Commissioner James O’Neil, a career cop, will be allowed to go where the evidence leads, utilizing every tool at its disposal and not bow to political correctness when investigating potential terrorists and their hideouts. Perhaps the tool most needed in fighting radical Islamic terrorism today is a strong backbone.",Ditch political correctness and wise up.

In February 2016, a wild elephant went on the rampage through a town in east India, smashing cars and homes before being tranquilized and returned to the forest.

The elephant had wandered from the Baikunthapur forest, crossing roads and a small river before entering the town in search of food, Basab Rai, divisional forest officer in the area, told the Associated Press at the time.

Variable yield mini nukes could potentially provide more flexibility and options.","In the Cold War era, the deterrence approach could be described as the bigger the nuclear bomb, the better. Are new mini nukes the right solution instead for today’s threat of a nuclear war?

President Trump is currently in South Korea for talks having just left a visit with a similarly concerned Japanese leadership about North Korea’s nuclear threats.

Earlier this year, Trump mandated a thorough review of America’s nuclear posture and ballistic missile defense. So back in the States, some of the brightest minds in the Department of Defense have been focused on this Review that will provide the President with recommendations and options relating to the threat of nuclear war.

WILL THE US UNLEASH REVOLUTIONARY 'LIGHTNINGSTRIKE' DRONE ON FUTURE ENEMIES?

Over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that about $400 billion dollars will be invested in modernizing and maintaining U.S. nuclear forces.

The U.S. has a vast and formidable nuclear arsenal and many methods from submarines to fighter jets to deliver those bombs. But much of the nuke program dates back to the Cold War and is feeling its age. The review could provide ideas to adapt, modernize and innovate so the United States is even more prepared to tackle today’s nuclear threats.

If there were to be a nuclear attack, then it is vital that Trump has the very best options at his disposal to deliver a just response.

Enter mini nukes?

The review has been very closely held with little hinted as to what the recommendations and options will be – but we do know that last year, the Defense Science Board’s “Seven Defense Priorities for the New Administration” report recommended that the Pentagon consider focusing on more low-yield nuclear weapons – aka “mini nukes.”

Aat a recent Mitchell Institute event, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force General Paul Selva delivered incisive remarks on the subject. He noted is important to provide the President with options and “Everything is on the table in the review, from conservative strategic approaches to radical new approaches.”

The Vice Chairman’s remarks triggered a buzz with many speculating on what the future could hold for “radical options.”

Smaller, variable, more “tactical” nukes are a strong contender for development by the military in the modernization process. Amidst the hubbub, these weapons found themselves nicknamed mini-nukes. In the simplest of terms, the idea is that the power of these nuclear weapons could be adjustable.

Think of it as a “dial a yield” bomb…this mini nuke could be dialed up for stronger destruction or dialed down for less.

The mini nukes factor

If mini nukes are recommended by the review, then Trump may soon have at his disposal the ability to target a specific neighborhood with a nuclear bomb - and leave the rest of a city undamaged by the explosion.

Each mini nuke could be tailored to the specific, necessary scale of destruction. For example, it could target and annihilate say a square mile – without the areas outside that mile being hit by the explosion.

More accurate nuclear strikes with an adjustable nuke warhead could reduce collateral damage and radioactive fallout.

Of course, radiation and other related threats would still expand well beyond the blast radius. The explosion would be far more restrained, but the damage to human life and the environment would reach beyond the blast limits.

PODCAST: FIND OUT THE TRUTH BEHIND THE DRONE HEADLINES WITH THIS INTELL OPERATIVE

So how could these new mini nukes be made?

There are two primary ways this capability could be developed. Some of the military's current nuclear weapon stockpile could be adapted or the military can also develop mini nukes from square one.

The military already has some very successful initiatives underway to make nukes smaller and more precise. For example, adjustments to the B61 bombs, enhanced with advanced tech like steerable fins, have already proven very successful.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

The U.S. President must have options

President Trump already has an array of staggeringly powerful nuclear weapons at his disposal and it will only be more enhanced and advanced with the modernization program.

Variable yield mini nukes could potentially provide more flexibility and options.

Advocates for mini nuke type capability have argued that if the U.S. is attacked by North Korea with a nuclear weapon, then Trump needs the ability to launch a calibrated, targeted nuclear attack in response.

A variable yield mini nuke could give the President the means to launch a more contained strike with less radioactive fallout.

Selecting this low-yield, tailored weapon instead of a massive high yield nuke, Trump could eliminate a specific dangerous threat without destructively impacting the entire region - including allies like South Korea and Japan.

PODCAST: MEET THE NAVY SEAL WHO BECAME HOLLYWOOD STAR IN TRANSFORMERS

Responding “in kind”

Another argument for new variable, mini nukes is that it would give the President further options to respond “in kind”. For example, it is believed that North Korea could possibly unleash a nuclear weapon at the scale of about 100-kilotons – that’s enough to potentially destroy a city. The U.S. possesses thousands of nukes in a wide range of destructive power.

If a country attacked the U.S. with a 100-kiloton nuclear weapon, then the mini nuke would give Trump the option of responding with a nuke adjusted to the same strength. This would be a response “in kind” with a similar low yield attack, rather than a high yield weapon.

Avoiding civilian casualties

This sort of adjustable mini nuke could also potentially enable the US to better discriminate by specifically targeting perpetrators and reducing civilian casualties.

High-yield nuclear weapons possess immense, destructive power that could yield unimaginable horrific destruction and countless deaths. Nukes are the most horrific of weapons.

If the most terrible scenario happens and the US needs to deploy a nuke, mini nukes may be one solution to ensuring this catastrophic weapon is precise and would allow Trump to avoid vast civilian casualties as much as possible.

To put this in context, rather than unleashing a nuclear weapon that could kill a country’s entire population in example, Trump would have the option to use a tailored mini nuke to target a dangerous military installation instead.

Mini nukes are not without detractors, though.

There is no shortage of critics with a range of concerns including the argument that it is exactly the mini nuke’s precision and the reduction of destruction that makes the option tempting. And since it is more tempting, it is more likely therefore that a nuclear weapon will be used.",North Korea: Will mini nukes become an option for Trump?,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/07/will-mini-nukes-become-option-for-trump.html

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.","In the world of conservative thought, few issues are as popular as tax reform. It's an accepted truth, by nearly anyone on the right, that the tax code is too complicated for an average citizen to understand and too laden with loopholes to be fair.

Beyond the structure of the code itself it's a fairly standard conservative view that taxes themselves are unjust, that government should not be confiscating a large chunk of our hard-earned pay and they certainly shouldn't then be helping themselves to additional taxes after that first take.

In a perfect conservative world there would either be no taxes at all or a tax which would be simple to understand, a flat tax or the Fair Tax. But we don't live in that perfect conservative world and so we recognize that tax policy, while still being burdensome, complicated and unfair, is used to achieve various societal objectives.

The marriage tax benefit, for example, is there to encourage people to get married. The electric vehicle credit exists to encourage people to reduce their oil consumption. The American Opportunity Tax Credit encourages people to go to post-secondary school such as colleges or trade schools. And so on.

What then can be seen as the point of the tax plan, called ""The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act” announced by the Republicans in the House of Representatives last Thursday? There are no obvious goals whatsoever in the convoluted plan.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.

The plan does absolutely nothing to simplify the process. No matter how many times Republican leadership promises that we’ll be able to do our taxes on a postcard, that’s not what the reality will be for nearly anyone. Credits and deductions will still exist though some have been targeted by this plan seemingly at random.

One such nonsensical target is the adoption tax credit. Where is the ideological sense in getting rid of a credit to ease the financial burden of adoption? Conservatives always suggest adoption as an alternative to abortion. But adoption is incredibly costly and the credit has been a boon to families looking to adopt, so why cut it?

“Who loses?” asked Laura Saunders in the Wall Street Journal. “Highly paid employees in high-tax states; future buyers of large homes or second homes; high-earning home sellers; people who take medical deductions; and future alimony payers, among others.”

Why get rid of the write-off for medical expenses? It’s practically an admission that single-payer is coming and Republicans don't plan to stop it. Why else not work to defray the costs of people paying for medical care out of pocket? How is that conservative?

Professionals will be hardest hit by the plan. People making $200,000-500,000 will see their taxes go up by 2023 according to a report released by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. Since when do Republicans want to disincentivize success? This isn’t targeting the super-rich, this is targeting the newly rich, families just achieving their American dream.

The mortgage interest rate deduction will drop from $1,000,000 to $500,000--an amount seemingly aimed specifically at people in blue states and the upper middle class.

The plan also doesn’t do anything for small businesses. It contains a provision to limit the tax burden to 25 percent for a small business. But as Josh Barro at Business Insider points out “More than 80 percent of tax filers with small-business income are already taxed at rates of 25 percent or less, so only the wealthiest business owners, who currently face high tax brackets, would get a tax cut.” The National Federation of Independent Business, generally a conservative group, said in a statement that they could not support the bill in its current form.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills. The free-market organization Club for Growth put out a statement noting that the bill “effectively punishes success and caves to the Democrats’ class warfare rhetoric.”

That leads to the question of why it’s such an over-compromised bill in the first place.

Conservatives claim to want a real simplification of the tax code. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has spent years promising this. If now, with a Republican House, Senate and presidency, isn’t the time to make bold moves on tax policy then when would be the time? This whole plan is an admission that Republican leadership are too afraid to ever be bold and that there will never be a true conservative movement to simplify or reduce taxes, no matter how many Republicans are elected to office.

What do conservatives believe or represent in 2017?

This Sunday, I was taking a special guest to our memorial site to tell her the miracle story of our healing, when the news broke that another church in South Texas had just experienced the same horror.

A military trained man with an assault rifle with the intent to kill unarmed people is almost impossible to stop. No amount of training could have prepared that tiny church in Texas for this evil. We’re now living in a violent society where even small-town America and small rural churches are not safe.

Church security was something I never heard discussed while growing up in North Louisiana. Guns were plentiful, but there seemed to be no threats to our safety in the sanctuaries of my youth. Today, the world has changed, and violence is seemingly always at our doorsteps.

We are not fearful, but we are wise. We are not downcast, but we are watchful.

The sad reality is that every church should have a strategy to protect its members when they gather. We had a great plan on December 9, 2007 that saved scores of lives and today, we are even more prepared. In fact, our church may be the safest public gathering place in our city. We take it seriously.

We have learned some valuable lessons. First, every church should hire at least one uniformed police officer to be visible in the main lobby and parking lot. Every Sunday, there is a police car parked in front of our church. These off-duty officers are paid by us to be present. They are now our friends and we see them as part of our vital team each weekend. Most crime studies show that criminals can be deterred by the physical presence of the police on property. If local police are not available, hire a very visible security guard.

When we first employed uniformed police, people were concerned that church would feel unsafe, but the opposite has happened. So many people have personally thanked me for having the officers present, because it is so reassuring. That is a huge testimony to our local police and sheriff’s department, who both have stellar reputations in our community.

Because we live in a military town, we’re able to recruit and train dozens of men and women to serve our church as volunteers. They spend all week protecting our nation and they love serving their church the same way. They dress in plain clothes, but walk the property during our worship services, serving our people.

We live in a state that allows most people to carry concealed weapons and to carry openly if they choose. We discourage our members from bringing guns into the church. In fact, if we know someone has a weapon, we escort them out to their car and watch them put it away. We have plenty of trained and qualified people who are appropriately armed, so extra weapons are not necessary and can actually cause more harm should there be a violent episode.

We train our team to be watchful and diligent, but not obtrusive or aggressive. In fact, most of the 10,000 or so people who attend our church are not even aware of the security team, other than noticing a police car out front. We are a church, not a sports stadium, so we do not have metal detectors, and we are not checking handbags as people enter.

Most of the violence that happens in a church is a spillover of some sort of domestic issue. Families target one another at church because they know they can be found at a certain time and place each week. Our pastors are sensitive to families going through divorce or some type of custody dispute with their children. If there’s a problem at home that could affect our church, we alert the police officer on duty. Many times, that officer has diffused conflict before it ever turns ugly and violent.

With all this attention to violence and securing our worship space, we have made sure that we have not lost our innocence along the way. We are not fearful, but we are wise. We are not downcast, but we are watchful. We gather every week, to pray our songs, to sing our prayers and to learn the Scriptures. We have chosen to forgive those who wish us harm and to bless those that speak evil against us.

Church is a holy gathering of imperfect people. People wrestling with mental health and those struggling with relationships come through our doors every day. Our security team makes it possible for them to find hope and healing in a very safe environment.","Pastor: Our church had a deadly shooting, too.

FLORIDA COUPLE GOES TO TACO BELL FOR POST-WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

Womer concedes that Cricket isn’t exactly smiling for the cameras.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.

“We had an experience back in 2016 where we had a bride come down in a carriage and they were going to walk it down the aisle,” he recalls. “As soon as one of the horses got close to the people, somebody had their back turned to it and then turned around and scared it, so it took off and actually flipped the carriage.”

The attack was the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history and the deadliest shooting in state history.

In light of the event, here’s what you need to know about Texas gun laws.

Texas gun law 101

Gun critics argue that Texas gun laws are relatively lax. But Justin Sparks, a Firearms Program Attorney through the Texas Law Shield, a legal defense fund, told Fox News on Monday that “Texas is probably the middle of the pack,” adding that “there’s not a lot of prohibiting, but there is a lot of supervising.”

“Generally speaking, in Texas, as long as you’re of age [18] and can pass the background check, you can buy a gun,” Sparks told Fox News.

However, a person must be 21-years-old before they can buy a handgun, he said.

Sparks added that there’s no special license to purchase a gun in Texas. Indeed, according to the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association, “a Texas resident, if not otherwise precluded by law, may purchase rifles and shotguns, ammunition, reloading components, or firearms accessories in contiguous states.”

There’s also no license to carry a gun once it’s purchased, he said. However, a permit is required to carry a handgun. And thanks to a bill that was passed in the Texas Legislature in 2015, handgun permit holders can now carry their handguns openly, Sparks said.

Overall, gun owners can keep the firearm in their home, vehicle or place of employment if their place of employment allows firearms in the building. In order to take it outside of those areas, however, a license is required, Sparks said.

Problems typically arise when “someone goes and buys a firearm and doesn’t educate themselves on where they can carry it, or leaves it out in the open in their car,” he said.

Who cannot buy a gun in Texas?

Texas adheres to federal law when it comes to who can and cannot buy a gun, Sparks said.

If a person has been convicted of a felony, they cannot buy a gun. Firearm distributors who have a Federal Firearm License, or a FLL, can easily find out if someone has been convicted of a felony by running a background check, Sparks said.

Additionally, if a person is under indictment for an “offense that can land you in jail for more than a year,” Sparks said, you cannot have a firearm in Texas.

But five years after a convicted felon completes his or her sentence, they can own a gun again -- if they keep it in their home. However, Sparks acknowledged that this Texas law conflicts with federal law-- meaning that if it’s reported, it could result in that person’s arrest.

Additionally, those who are deemed “mentally unfit” by the state are prohibited from owning a gun -- an issue that Sparks said is “evolving” within the Texas legislature.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if the state eventually passes something that requires a disclosure of all mental health records-- even if they [the gun purchaser] were at a private mental health facility,” he said.

Given his background, how did Devin Kelley get a gun?

Kelley previously served in the U.S. Air Force, but was discharged in 2014, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News on Monday.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child. He was then sentenced to 12 months in custody before being given a bad conduct discharge.

A 1968 Gun Control Act made it unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell a weapon to any person who is given a dishonorable discharge. But because Kelley was discharged on bad conduct, the law was not triggered, Adam Winkler, a professor of law and a specialist in American constitutional law at the University of California at Los Angeles, told Fox News on Monday.

Kelley purchased two firearms from two separate Academy Sports + Outdoors stores in San Antonio in 2016 and 2017, respectively, the sporting goods store confirmed to Fox News in a statement on Monday. One of the purchases was allegedly a Ruger model AR-556 rifle.

“We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further,” the statement reads.



However, Kelley’s domestic violence charges should’ve been enough to prevent him from purchasing a gun, Winkler said -- but the Air Force most likely didn’t report this information to the federal background check system, thus allowing the purchase to go forward.

“The underlying crime [domestic violence] in and of itself should’ve been enough,” Winkler said.

“But for some reason, the military hasn’t been reporting bad conduct discharges.”

And Winkler’s prediction was right: The Air Force announced late Monday night that the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations -- the base where Kelley was stationed -- failed to report Kelley’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. The database is used to conduct background checks on those who want to purchase a gun.

If the Air Force had reported the conviction, the purchase would’ve been prevented because of the Lautenberg Amendment, which enacted by Congress in 1996. The federal law prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from buying or possessing a gun.

In response, the Heather Wilson, the secretary for the Air Force, told “Fox and Friends” Tuesday that the Air Force is launching a “complete and full-scale review of this case and all others like it” to ensure something similar doesn’t happen in the future.

“If we find a problem, we’ll fix it,” she added.

The gunman was also denied a Texas handgun permit, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told “Fox & Friends” on Monday.

""He was rejected either because he did not fully answer all the questions that are required to get a Texas gun permit, or he answered those questions wrong, that we still don't know,"" Abbott said.

The “biggest mystery,” Winkler said, is how Kelley was denied a handgun permit but was allowed to purchase a gun from the sporting goods store. But this information is currently unclear.



Additionally, Texas authorities confirmed Monday that Kelley did not have a license to carry. However, he did have a private security license -- often used by armed and unarmed security guards, personal protection officers, private investigators, and more, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

A criminal background check is typically required before someone can receive a private security license.",Texas gun law rules and regulations,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/07/texas-gun-law-rules-and-regulations.html

Trump suggested in a news conference the U.S. will arm Japan and declared Pyongyang “a threat to the civilized world.”

Trump is expected to spend Tuesday in South Korea, but is not expected to visit the DMZ, the border that has separated North and South Korea for 64 years, because “there is not enough time in the schedule,” a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. Trump will instead visit Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul.

“I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing,” Trump said. I think we are showing great strength. Unparalleled strength. We have three aircraft carriers positioned.

The press conference occurred on the heels of a two-day visit to the Korea peninsula as part of Trump’s first visit to Asia amid tensions with Pyongyang.

But as he began his two-day South Korean visit just three dozen miles from the heavily-fortified DMZ, he initially struck a different, more hopeful tone.

He declared that ""it always works out. Has to work out.""

NEW DETAILS REVEALED IN CALIFORNIA MOMS DISAPPEARANCE

This year, Britt and his friends decided on the theme of ""Psycho Motel."" Britt said it was inspired by a number of horror movies.

“It’s kind of a mish-mash of horrors,"" he said. “Incorporating everything from different movies mixing it up to make like a psycho killer clown area.""

Britt explained this year was tough on his family after his grandmother passed away five months ago from sarcoma, a rare cancer that affects the bones and soft tissues, according to the American Cancer Society.

“It’s been hard for my family since my grandma passed away from cancer so we’re going to start doing charity nights,” Britt said. “I just took it really hard. She was always there for me.”

Britt told FOX5 that this Saturday the house will be open for free to the public and donations are welcome. All the money will be given to the American Cancer Society.

But it's also apparently really, really prone to damage.

In a study to identify just how well the iPhone X could hold, CNET put Apple's handset through the paces. The site found that while keys didn't do any visible damage to the handset, sandpaper caused some scratches.

But it was the site's very first drop test that is the most cause for concern. At a height of just three feet, or around where your pocket would be, the iPhone X fell onto its back and saw its rear panel cracked in a few spots, causing the glass back panel to go from attractive to damaged in one fell swoop.

Next up, CNET tried dropping the iPhone X face down, and again, the iPhone X took a beating with cracks on both its front and rear panels. The iPhone itself was operating fine, according to CNET, but the damage was already done.

While CNET's testing was a bit closer to real life and how you might actually interact with an iPhone X — or damage it, for that matter — a video has surfaced from TechRax to see just how much of a beating the iPhone X can take.

SquareTrade, a company that provides extended warranty plans on devices, also analyzed the iPhone X. Its finding? Apple's smartphone is the ""most breakable iPhone"" the company has ever tested, earning a score of 90 out of a possible 100 in breakability (lower is better).

""The most breakable, highest-priced, most expensive to repair iPhone, ever,"" SquareTrade said in its own video showing just how easily the iPhone X could be damaged.

In a video published recently, TechRax showed what it would take to damage the iPhone X when you take both a knife and a hammer to the handset — something the vast majority of iPhone X owners wouldn't even try.

First up, TechRax took a knife to the handset's backplate and started stabbing away. However, after several stabs and attempts to crack the screen with the knife, the iPhone X held up. TechRax was impressed by the performance, saying many other devices aren't able to withstand such damage.

Next up, it was hammer time. But unfortunately, the iPhone X couldn't hold up to the hammer, and after just a few whacks, the smartphone's screen was shattered. It wasn't long after a few more whacks that the iPhone X continued to be damaged and was ultimately rendered useless.",iPhone X is 'most breakable iPhone ever',https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/07/iphone-x-is-most-breakable-iphone-ever.html

The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week’s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.

On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.

“Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,” Wells said. ""I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.”

Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.

The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells’ decision.

“We will not allow Mr. Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans,"" the statement read. ""We, as an organization, have decided to move on from this sad and divisive discourse and focus our attention on supporting our military and veterans.”

That’s what a 53-year-old woman learned Thursday afternoon when she was stopped by Polk County sheriff deputies while riding down a busy highway in Florida.

Officials said a passerby noticed a woman who appeared confused and possibly in danger along Combee Road near North Crystal Lake Road in Lakeland.

When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse on the road and had an odor of alcohol, red watery eyes and was staggering, Fox 13 Tampa reported.

Officers did a sobriety test and said she gave breath samples that registered blood-alcohol level of .161 — twice Florida's legal limit of .08.

Byrne is charged with DUI and animal neglect for endangering and failing to provide proper protection for the horse.

""Ms. Byrne was obviously not in any condition to be on the road,"" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. ""She not only put herself and the horse in danger but also anyone who was driving on the road, which is typically very busy.""

Deputies took the horse to the Polk County Sheriff's Animal Control livestock facility. She was booked into the Polk County Jail. Jail records did not list an attorney for her.

As President Trump travels overseas. Republicans hetre at home are working on pushing a tax reform plan through Congress.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

House Speaker Paul Ryan on FOX News Sunday says the reform bill with a trillion-dollar tax cut is on pace to pass the House by Thanksgiving. But critics say key deductions are being left out of the proposal.

Host Chris Wallace pressed the Speaker on what it could mean for many, like those paying off student loans:

(Wallace) ""If I'm able to deduct the interest rate. Now I'm losing that, if I have huge medical expenses and I'm able to deduct the medical.""

(Ryan) ""In exchange for a tax cut, so you get to keep your money more in the first place. So you get to decide what you want to do with your money.""

The GOP hopes to have a bill on the President's desk by year's end.

They said in a statement Friday that officers determined ""the object, which really did look very like a bomb"" was actually a 40-centimeter (nearly 16-inch) zucchini.

The offending vegetable, which was very dark in color, weighed about five kilograms (11 pounds). Police believe someone threw it over a hedge into the garden.

The weapon was detected as it passed through the security checkpoint’s X-ray machine. The gun was loaded with seven bullets, including one in the chamber, authorities said.

Agents from Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority confiscated the firearm and charged Berry with “carrying a dangerous weapon in an airport terminal.”

TSA reports show the number of guns confiscated at checkpoints has increased every year since 2007. In 2016, about 3,391 guns were discovered in carry-ons – a 28 percent increase from 2015.

“Just because we find a prohibited item on an individual does not mean they had bad intentions,” the TSA wrote. “In many cases, people simply forgot they had these items.”

That may have been the case with Berry. According to MWAA spokesman Andrew Trull, Berry told officers that “he forget he had the weapon.”

NEW YORK — September 18, 2017 – FOX News Channel (FNC) has named Laura Ingraham as the host of The Ingraham Angle, a new live primetime program to debut on October 30th, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for the network. Ahead of Ingraham’s debut, Hannity, hosted by Sean Hannity, will move to the 9PM/ET hour, the ensemble program The Five will return to the 5PM/ET timeslot, while the 10PM/ET hour will be helmed by rotating hosts during the interim period.

Martha, Tucker and Sean have proven that they understand the pulse of America across the political and the cultural spectrum. I look forward to informing and entertaining the audience and introducing new voices to the conversation.”

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day.

Brazile, former interim DNC chair, pulled no punches in going after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’ leadership style. In her book “Hacks,” released Tuesday, Brazile recalled how she was briefed upon taking over for Schultz on the many perks meant to keep the chair “fat and happy” – including a “big Tahoe SUV” with a driver, a “body woman” and more.

“Debbie had a chief of staff and a body woman. She also had media consultants and a fund-raising consultant. I was free to hire my own consultants, two or three if I liked, and bring in a new communications team. All of that would go on the DNC payroll,” she wrote.

Brazile was briefed on all these benefits by the liaison with Clinton’s campaign. Brazile wrote that she told him she’d sell the SUV and drive herself, and would not hire consultants.

“And God knows I didn’t need a body woman,” she wrote.

BRAZILE LEVELS SEXISM ACCUSATION AGAINST CLINTON TOP DOG

She voiced surprise at the spending considering she was informed “the party was broke and $2 million in debt” when she took over, with the party spending upwards of $4 million a month. Stripping the extra expenses was “one way of getting the burn rate down,” she wrote, questioning how many “hangers-on and sycophants were draining the lifeblood out of this party.”

Brazile’s book sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party last week after the allegation first surfaced that the DNC had struck a special deal with the Clinton campaign, giving it partial control over party resources while the campaign helped with the DNC’s troubled finances.

Brazile suggested that the perks helped fuel this situation.

“This was the way to keep the chair fat and happy: Give her a huge staff and lots of perks and don’t ask her to do anything,” she wrote.

Early book excerpts also revealed that Brazile considered trying to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee amid questions about Clinton's health -- and included allegations of sexism against some campaign officials.

Clinton campaign members have fired back at Brazile’s account. An open letter signed by dozens of team members said: “Donna came in to take over the DNC at a very difficult time. We were grateful to her for doing so. She is a longtime friend and colleague of many of us and has been an important leader in our party. But we do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.”",Donna Brazile rips Schultz over 'perks' that kept chair 'fat and happy' amid DNC cash crunch,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/07/donna-brazile-rips-schultz-over-perks-that-kept-chair-fat-and-happy-amid-dnc-cash-crunch.html

The Cambridge professor said while AI could be hugely beneficial for reducing poverty, disease and restoring the natural environment, it’s impossible to predict “what we might achieve when our own minds are amplified by AI”.

“AI could be the worst invention of the history of our civilization, that brings dangers like powerful autonomous weapons or new ways for the few to oppress the many.”

“AI could develop a will of its own, a will that is in conflict with ours and which could destroy us. In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity.”

Addressing the crowd of engineers and tech workers at the “vanguard” of AI development, Hawking warned they needed to focus on maximizing benefits for society rather than pure capability.

“We need to employ effective management in all areas of its development,” he said. “We stand on a threshold of a brave new world. It is an exciting, if precarious place to be and you are the pioneers.”

The address set the scene for three days of talks between high-profile tech, business and government leaders grappling with ethical implications of everything from self-driving cars to sex dolls.

Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrove called tech’s current crossroads the “kind of inflection point that happens once in several lifetimes.” High-profile speakers including United Nations Secretary General Antonito Guterres and European Union’s commissioner for Competition Margarethe Vestager also took the stage on Monday and joined calls for an ethical approach that reduces inequality.

Kernel founder Bryan Johnson, who has plowed $100 million into his company to “hack the human brain,” agrees we’re on the threshold of the “most consequential revolution in the history of the human race.”

“The future is like a Category 5 hurricane that’s going to bear down on us with so much force the single greatest thing we can do as a species is work on our adaptability to change,” he said.

The European Union’s competition commissioner Vestager, who has fined Apple $19 billion over unpaid taxes in Ireland and Google $3.6 billion for disadvantaging others with its algorithm, said the main challenge for governments is to develop the tools to keep up with the rapid pace of change.

“We have to take our democracy back and renew it, because society is about people and not about technology,” she said. “You cannot just say what happens in the black box stays in the black box.”

8 Ways Aliens Could Contact Us]Adapted aliensTaking natural selection as a starting point, Levin and his colleagues asked what that reveals about how aliens might look.
""Theoretical predictions, like the ones we make, are not tied to the details of Earth,"" Levin said.
Aliens that have undergone natural selection would be ""nested,"" Levin said — they would have undergone transformations in complexity over time, and they'd retain some evidence of those transitions.","What would life in a far-flung star system look like? Would humans even recognize it as life?

A new theory says yes, we would. In fact, life on other planets (or moons, or asteroids) might look surprisingly similar to life here on Earth, University of Oxford scientists wrote in a paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology on Oct. 31. That's because life on other planets would likely be subject to natural selection, just like life on Earth is. And if life is subject to natural selection, it is likely to share similarities, even if it isn't carbon-based, for example, or codes its operating instructions in a way entirely different from DNA.

""Living things are adapted,"" study co-author Samuel Levin, a doctoral candidate in zoology at the University of Oxford, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""They appear to be 'trying to do things' like eat, survive, grow, reproduce.""

The only way to adapt, Levin said, is through natural selection, the process through which hereditary variation among individuals leads to differences in success, and ultimately survival of the fittest.

""Anything that will stand out to us as alien life will have undergone natural selection,"" Levin said. [Greetings, Earthlings! 8 Ways Aliens Could Contact Us]

Adapted aliens

Taking natural selection as a starting point, Levin and his colleagues asked what that reveals about how aliens might look. This is a theoretical approach to the question, Levin said. Many astrobiologists take what's called a ""mechanistic"" approach, looking at how life has evolved on Earth — say, around deep-sea vents — and try to apply that to the environments of distant planets. Mechanistic predictions have their strengths, Levin said, but because the sample size of planets with known life is just one, it's hard to know what is unique to Earth and what would hold true in space. For example, eyes or eye-like structures have evolved independently about 40 times on Earth, but it's not clear if aliens would also have eyes or whether sight is an Earth-centric sense.

""Theoretical predictions, like the ones we make, are not tied to the details of Earth,"" Levin said. ""They hold regardless of whether aliens are made of carbon or silicon, have DNA or 'XNA,' breathe oxygen or nitrogen, etc.""

Theoretical predictions cannot determine anything as specific as whether aliens would look more like E.T. or the Predator, but natural selection does lead to certain kinds of organisms. Aliens that have undergone natural selection would be ""nested,"" Levin said — they would have undergone transformations in complexity over time, and they'd retain some evidence of those transitions. On Earth, genes ""cooperated"" to make genomes, genomes made blueprints for cells, and primitive cells eventually joined together to make more complex eukaryotic cells. (Mitochondria, the energy-transforming organelles of eukaryotic cells, were once separate organisms that entered a mutually beneficial relationship with their host cells.) Cells join together to make multicellular organisms, and multicellular organisms often cooperate in colonies or societies.

Getting to know the neighbors

To illustrate the concept, Levin and his colleagues dreamed up a tuber-like alien they called the ""Octomite,"" a complex creature made up of smaller entities that have aligned their interests so that they cooperate, much like the human body's cells work together to keep a person alive.

""Are we alone?"" is one of the fundamental questions of the universe, Levin said, so it's worth pondering the sort of life we might run across if we do find E.T. out there.

""On a more philosophical level, understanding what features will be universal to life, wherever it exists, seems deeply rewarding,"" Levin said. ""Our work can't answer the question of whether we're alone, but it does tell us something about our neighbors if we're not alone.""

Over the weekend, apparel company Alpha Industries launched an antifa-influenced M-65 Anarchy Cotton-Blend Field Jacket on high-end retailer Barneys' website.

Now the $375 military-style canvas zip-up with “stand collar” and “snap flap patch pockets,” is getting slammed by the demographic it was trying to market to – antifa members and anarchists.

WHY IVANKA TRUMP IS A ROLE MODEL — AND FASHION ICON — IN JAPAN

The olive green jacket, which is posed with designer distressed jeans and Doc Marten boots – a symbol of punk fashion – features a bold “Revolution” printed across the front, along with a sloppy anarchy symbol and other ""edgy"" phrases and quips.

Angelyn Fernandez, VP of Product at Alpha Industries, said in an e-mailed statement to the Daily Dot, “We have seen resistance to power and authority become a trend in our current pop culture and society, often expressed through fashion,” she said.

However, that attempt to capitalize on the pop culture “trend” of resistance to power is what has many outraged on Twitter. Some have questioned if the jacket is fake because of its bizarrely high-price tag (members of the antifa movement are usually against capitalism) and over-the-top look.

The commercialized jacket tries very hard to look authentically anarchist, while also costing nearly $400 and being mass-produced, but is not winning any fans.

Alpha Industries, which “started as a contractor for the U.S. Military,” said in a statement to Fox News, “Since 1965, the M65 field jackets have been a favored method to graphically express one’s opinion.”

“Alpha developed the Barneys M65 anarchy jacket to encompass the artistic and graphic expressions of individuality. Self-expression often inspires fashion, and fashion inspires self expression. Alpha Industries recognizes that the M65 field jacket has and will remain a canvas for all manner of self expression,” the statement continues.

People on Twitter aren't buying the ""self-expression"" angle. One user is even claiming this is an attempt to silence anti-facism members by making them “trendy.” While another is calling for a complete boycott of Barneys, who is selling the jacket.

Other Twitter users argue, however, that the coat will be purchased by ""ANTIFA cowards"" and ""privileged Millennials.""

According to the Sanctuary Asia Foundation, these type of scenes are common in the Bankura district of West Bengal.

""The ignorance and bloodlust of mobs that attack herds for fun, is compounded by the plight of those that actually suffer damage to land, life and property by wandering elephants and the utter indifference of the central and state government to recognize the crisis that is at hand,"" the magazine said in a note accompanying the photograph.

In February 2016, a wild elephant went on the rampage through a town in east India, smashing cars and homes before being tranquilized and returned to the forest.

The elephant had wandered from the Baikunthapur forest, crossing roads and a small river before entering the town in search of food, Basab Rai, divisional forest officer in the area, told the Associated Press at the time.

On June 17, 1972, E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy checked into room 214 at the Watergate Hotel. From the room, the pair orchestrated the break-in at Democratic National Convention headquarters, right next to the hotel. Hooked up with microphones and radios, the two directed the “plumbers” as they attempted to wiretap the offices.

However at that time, a Watergate security guard noticed that the doors of the nearby office building were taped open. He notified police, who showed up in time to catch the “plumbers” red handed.

The incident is one of the most notorious events in 20th-century American politics. And so, in honor of the hotel’s 50th anniversary this year, they transformed room 214 into the “Scandal Room.”

The room is, of course, named after the scandalous history that took place there, but also after one very popular T.V. show. The hotel tasked Lyn Paolo, the costume designer on “Scandal,” with the mission of redecorating their most famous room.

Inside room 214, guests will find newspaper clippings about the scandal on the wall. Much of the furniture inside the room is reminiscent of what would have adorned a political office in the early 1970s, including a vintage typewriter and desk.

9 p.m.

President Donald Trump is hinting at a surprise announcement as he prepares to depart South Korea.

Trump says during a toast at a state dinner being held in his honor in Seoul Tuesday that, ""we're going to have an exciting day tomorrow for many reasons"" that ""people will find out.""

South Korea's presidential office says U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have agreed to open ""working-level"" discussions between the countries over South Korea's potential acquisition of nuclear-propelled submarines.

President Donald Trump is beginning his two-day Korean peninsula visit walking amid weapons of war but voicing optimism for peace.

His every move will be closely watched from both sides of Korea's demilitarized zone.

Trump has repeatedly delivered combative warnings to Pyongyang as he urged it to abandon its nuclear program.

But as he began his two-day South Korean visit just three dozen miles from the heavily-fortified DMZ, he initially struck a different, more hopeful tone.

He declared that ""it always works out. Has to work out.""

That echoed the sentiment of his tweet hours earlier, when he left Japan for South Korea, the second stop of his lengthy Asian trip. It is centered on pressuring North Korean dictator Kim Jong to abandon his weapons program.

The Management Group (TMG) alleged it gave the “Murder on the Orient Express” star the loan to help him pay a City National Bank (CNB) loan, People reported.

JOHNNY DEPP ALLEGEDLY SHOWED UP DRUNK TO MOVIE PREMIERE, REPORTS SAY

“TMG agreed to come to the aid of its long-time client,” the complaint stated. “The idea behind this arrangement, which was designed to save Depp from a public and devastating financial collapse, was that Depp would pay TMG what TMG was required to pay CNB under the loan.”

Adam Waldman, Depp’s attorney, told People the actor would not sell his homes and called the action an “effort to intimidate Depp into dropping his lawsuit.”

In February, Depp sued TMG for $25 million, accusing the company of fraud and attempting to foreclose his main home.

“As a result of years of gross mismanagement and sometimes outright fraud, Mr. Depp lost tens of millions of dollars and has been forced to dispose of significant assets to pay for TMG’s self-dealing and gross misconduct,” the complaint stated.

“In essence, TMG treated Mr. Depp’s income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired.”

Depp and the company parted ways in March 2016 after 17 years together.

TMG said it gave Depp the loan to “save him from bankruptcy,” People reported. The actor’s former managers said the five homes in question were used as “collateral for the loan, and since Depp has stopped making payments, they want to sell the houses.”

“At least at the time, Depp and his sister, personal manager, and the president of his production company, (Elisa Christi) Dembrowski, were very grateful to TMG for coming to Depp’s aid and helping him to avoid a public financial collapse,” the complaint stated.

Depp’s former managers also accused the Academy Award-nominated actor of mismanaging the $650 million he made in the last two decades.

After the actor sued TMG in February, the company filed a cross-complaint against the movie star stating Depp “lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost [him] in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.”

Other findings in Timna Valley include preserved leftovers from a mining camp called Slaves' Hill.","The skeleton of a pregnant woman, dating back around 3,200 years, has been found near a temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Hathor at a place that was once called King Solomon's Mines, archaeologists recently announced.

Located in the Timna Valley in Israel, ancient Egyptians and others in the region used the mines for copper mining. Early archaeologists and explorers believed that King Solomon, an ancient Israeli ruler, controlled the Timna mines. However, many scholars now think the claim is unlikely.

Archaeologists discovered the pregnant woman's skeleton buried in a tumulus (a tomb covered by rocks) near Hathor's temple. The people worshipped Hathor — the goddess of love, pleasure and maternity — at Timna, and considered her to be the protector of the miners. [See Photos of the Burial and Skeletal Remains in Timna Valley]

At the time the pregnant woman lived, Egypt controlled the mines at Timna, suggesting she was Egyptian. In addition, she may have been a singer at the Hathor temple, said Erez Ben-Yosef, the director of the Central Timna Valley Project and a senior lecturer in archaeology at Tel Aviv University. She was buried with beads whose design is similar to those found at the Hathor temple, Ben-Yosef told Live Science.

An examination of her remains indicates she was in her early 20s and in the first trimester of her pregnancy when she died. The cause of her death is unknown.

The woman likely accompanied one of the mining expeditions sent to the Timna Valley to extract copper; she would have served in the Hathor temple while mining operations were underway. The rituals and ceremonies performed at the temple were important, since Hathor was thought to protect the miners.

It's not known whether the woman traveled to Timna from Egypt while she was pregnant or whether she was impregnated while serving at the Hathor temple, Ben-Yosef said. ""Probably she wouldn't have traveled if she knew she was pregnant, but this is only a guess.

Egypt's power in the Timna area weakened in the century after the woman died, and Egypt eventually lost control of the mines to other groups in the region.

Other findings in Timna Valley include preserved leftovers from a mining camp called Slaves' Hill. Those leftovers suggested the metalworkers ate meals of sheep and goat, as well as pistachios, grapes and fish during the 10th century B.C. More recently at Slaves' Hill, scientists revealed the remains of a sophisticated gatehouse and donkey stables that suggested the settlement had a highly organized defense system. In another discovery, archaeologists reported in 2013 that they had dug up artifacts in the valley that dated to the time of the biblical King Solomon.

Other research is underway to get a better understanding of the history of Timna.

The article goes on to suggest that lyrics from Swift’s songs and imagery from her videos is meant to embolden racists.
Many on the alt-right see the song as part of a ‘re-awakening,’ in line with Trump’s rise,” the article reads.

On Monday, the ACLU sent a letter to Swift's legal team arguing that an article posted by PopFront that links the star to the white supremacy movement should not be taken down -- as Swift has requested -- because the writer has the right to free speech.



Things kicked off on Sept. 5 when PopFront posted an article by Meghan Herning titled, “Swiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation.” In it, the writer suggests that white supremacists co-opting Swift's music as a message of support for their beliefs is no accident. The article declares that Swift’s silence on matters of politics is a statement in and of itself, and it calls upon her to formally denounce white supremacy.

“Silence in the face of injustice means support for the oppressor,” the article states.

The article goes on to suggest that lyrics from Swift’s songs and imagery from her videos is meant to embolden racists.

“Taylor’s lyrics in ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ seem to play to the same subtle, quiet white support of a racial hierarchy. Many on the alt-right see the song as part of a ‘re-awakening,’ in line with Trump’s rise,” the article reads. “At one point in the accompanying music video, Taylor lords over an army of models from a podium, akin to what Hitler had in Nazis Germany. The similarities are uncanny and unsettling.”

On Oct. 25, Herning received a letter from Swift’s attorneys demanding that the website issue a retraction and take the article down immediately, threatening a lawsuit if they did not remove it by Oct. 24, one day before the letter was dated.

According to Variety, Herning contacted the ACLU of Northern California for help, and on Monday the group sent a letter of its own, which it made public on the ACLU's website, arguing that Swift’s request is a violation of the first amendment.

“Ms. Herning and PopFront will not in any way accede to your attempt to suppress their constitutionally protected speech,” the letter from the ACLU reads. “The blog post is a mix of core political speech and critical commentary; it discusses current politics in this country, the recent rise of white supremacy, and the fact that some white supremacists have apparently embraced Ms. Swift, along with a critical interpretation of some of Ms. Swift’s music, lyrics, and videos.”

Later in the 6-page response to Swift’s attorney, the ACLU takes a jab at one of the artist’s lyrics saying, “Criticism is never pleasant, but a celebrity has to shake it off, even if the critique may damage her reputation.”

The ACLU issued its own deadline, telling Swift that her legal team has until Nov. 13 to decide if they’re planning to move forward with litigation or not.",ACLU defends article linking Taylor Swift to white supremacists,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/aclu-responds-after-taylor-swift-threatens-lawsuit-over-defamatory-article-linking-her-to-white-supremacists.html

A little girl who was born with a life-threatening heart condition saw a big wish come true recently, when she was able to “marry” her best friend in a special playground ceremony. Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone, of Connecticut, has already undergone two open-heart surgeries and several other procedures, and had made the special request ahead of a third surgery, which is scheduled for January at Boston Children’s Medical Center, Yahoo reported.

On Oct. 23, Sophia and her best friend, Hunter, who she met in preschool, joined together on a playground and exchanged “vows” while photographer Marisa Balletti-Lavoie of Sassy Mouth Photo captured the precious images. The idea came from the pint-sized bride herself, and was happily agreed to by Hunter and his mom.

Sophia was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, which is a genetic heart defect involving four different issues, shortly after her birth. Sophia’s mother, Kristy Somerset-Chiappalone, started the “Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone the beautiful baby with a broken heart” Facebook page and explained that her daughter’s case is considered severe and will require several open-heart procedures before it is completely repaired. The condition is also likely to shorten her lifespan, and she will need a heart and lung transplant in the future.

FAMILY SEES HOPE IN GENE THERAPY FOR SON DIAGNOSED WITH FATAL NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE

“She’s a walking miracle,” Somerset-Chiappalone told NBC Connecticut. “There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.”

Balletti-Lavoie told Yahoo she was asked to do the shoot by Hunter’s mom, Tracy Laferriere, who is a close friend. Shortly after she shared photos of the pair on her Facebook page, their story went viral.

“I cannot help but be overwhelmed by the love and support we’ve gotten with Sophia and her recent wish,” Somerset-Chiappalone posted on her personal Facebook page, on Oct. 25. “It was pure innocence in the purest form. My heart aches with joy with the people standing behind Supergirl on this fight. She’s fought to be alive since her first breath, but that’s all she knows. I love the idea of sharing the beautiful story that is her and Hunter. Most people wait a lifetime for someone who wouldn’t stand by them through such illness.

“I completed my review of the DNC and I did find the cancer,” Brazile said she admitted to Sanders in September 2016.
She told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that her critics “can go to hell.” She added: ""I'm going to tell my story.
The reason why so many Democrats wish Brazile would shut up is actually quite clear.
I’ve known Donna Brazile for nearly 20 years, since she became the first female campaign manager for a major party nominee during Al Gore’s 2000 campaign.","Most Democrats are publicly muting their criticism of Donna Brazile, a longtime party operative whose new tell-all book has shaken Washington with its revelations about how the Hillary Clinton campaign took control of the supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee. But privately, they are furious at Brazile’s charges that Clinton controlled the DNC and tilted the primary playing field to help her defeat Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

The book – titled “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdown That Put Donald Trump in the White House” – came out Tuesday, but Brazille released excerpts last week and has been giving media interviews.

Brazile, a longtime Clinton ally, was tapped in mid-2016 to lead the embattled DNC after former chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in July after leaked internal emails showed key members of her staff speaking critically of Bernie Sanders in his primary fight against Clinton.

“I completed my review of the DNC and I did find the cancer,” Brazile said she admitted to Sanders in September 2016. “I explained that the cancer was [Clinton] and [she] had exerted this control of the party long before she became the nominee.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic progressive, when asked on Thursday if the DNC was rigged to favor Clinton, responded with one word: “yes.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, also called the primary “rigged.” She stepped down as a Democratic Party vice chair during the primaries over her frustration with the DNC.

Brazile also said she pondered a move to replace Clinton as the Democratic nominee after the candidate contracted pneumonia, covered up the illness and then collapsed in New York at a 9/11 memorial ceremony.

Robby Mook, the former campaign manager for Clinton, says it is “laughable” that the DNC could have tilted the race to his candidate. He says the controversy should be forgotten.

A group of dozens of other Clinton campaign staffers signed an open letter saying “we do not recognize the campaign she [Brazile] portrays in the book.” The open letter added: “Finally, we are pretty tired of people who were not part of our campaign telling the world what it was like to be on the inside of our campaign and how we felt about it.”

Other staffers are privately depicting Brazile to reporters as “confused” or even “crazy” in telling her story.

Brazile isn’t taking the criticism lying down. She told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that her critics “can go to hell.” She added: ""I'm going to tell my story. Why am I supposed to be the only person who is unable to tell my story?""

The reason why so many Democrats wish Brazile would shut up is actually quite clear. Democrats traditionally paper over any conflicts in their party, and most media outlets cooperate by downplaying tensions – while eagerly portraying any disagreements inside the GOP as a potential “civil war.”

Democrats worry that if the tensions inside their party break out into the open, their carefully constructed coalition of identity groups – from gays to environmentalists to African-Americans – will fray around the edges.

But this time, silence about internal fights isn’t likely to hold. It’s been a year since Clinton lost the presidential election to Donald Trump in a shocking upset. Clinton continues to blame everyone but herself – from Russia, to Bernie Sanders, to then-FBI Director James Comey – for her loss. So it shouldn’t be surprising that frustrated Democrats are finally returning fire.

“A lot of Democrats believe it’s past time for the party to move on beyond the Clintons, and understanding what happened in the 2016 campaign is part of a necessary conversation,” says Doug Schoen, a former adviser to the Clintons in the 1990s and currently a Fox News contributor.

I’ve known Donna Brazile for nearly 20 years, since she became the first female campaign manager for a major party nominee during Al Gore’s 2000 campaign. I have always found her forthright and a cut above traditional political hacks, who will explain away anything inconvenient in their party.

Democrats should recognize that however painful Brazile’s revelations may be in the short term, sweeping them under the rug will only mean they will reemerge in the 2020 campaign as the party’s progressive and pragmatic factions again fight over will control the party.","Donna Brazile, you were absolutely right to tell Democrats to 'go to hell'",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/donna-brazile-were-absolutely-right-to-tell-democrats-to-go-to-hell.html

All-wheel drive will still be a hallmark with future electric vehicles, Lamborghini said in the statement.

The Lamborghini Terzo Millenio was unveiled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in the automaker’s hometown of Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy. It is the first result of a partnership between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the exclusive carmaker.

It also represents the first solid step toward a future all-electric supercar from Lamborghini, although CEO Stefano Domenicali told journalists in March at the 2017 Geneva motor show that future may be some ways off.

“Electrification is an area of great attention for us, but I‘m not expecting it will happen in the short term,” Domenicali told Reuters. Domenicali also ruled out an all-electric car before 2025.

Trading batteries for supercapacitors and lightweight aluminum with self-healing, energy-storing carbon fiber, the Terzo Millennio is full of pie-in-the-sky technology promises, but its declaration is clear: some future Lamborghinis will run solely on electrons.

Supercar supercapacitors

According to the automaker, developing supercapacitors may be the key to unlocking rapid charging and discharging cycles for future supercars—perhaps skipping conventional batteries altogether.

Lamborghini is mum about the energy density required from supercapacitors to deliver enough storage to power a car like the Terzo Millennio, but it said that using body panels and other parts of the car to act as improvised energy storage panels may be the key.

“The new Lamborghini collaboration allows us to be ambitious and think outside the box in designing new materials that answer energy storage challenges for the demands of an electric sport vehicle,” MIT chemistry Professor Mircea Dinca said in a statement.

In addition to energy storing body panels, MIT professors and Lamborghini say that the carbon fiber structure in the Terzo Millennio may be able to identify and “heal” small cracks in its substructure, presumably with liquid-filled micro-channels in its construction. Little cracks can become big cracks, according to the automaker, and a small measure of self-healing can prevent sudden failure—a problem with carbon fiber.

But even Wolverine needs power, too, however, and for that Lamborghini said that the Terzo Millennio is equipped with four electric motors, one at each wheel. All-wheel drive will still be a hallmark with future electric vehicles, Lamborghini said in the statement.

Sooner than we think?

An element of the Terzo Millennio that may not take a generation to develop could be the car’s “Piloted Driving” systems.

So-called “roboracers” aren’t new, but Lamborghini said that its Terzo Millennio could be loaded with an ideal line around a racetrack such as Imola, shuttle its driver around the track first, then act as a virtual ghost car for successive laps.

The technology has appeared in other VW-parent products such as an Audi RS 7 that lapped the Hockenheimring in Germany and an Audi TTS that made an autonomous run up Pikes Peak in the U.S.

Neither car has the same low, menacing profile that the Lamborghini sports, a signal that the automaker’s avant garde shape will continue well into the “third millennium” that the Terzo Millennio purports to herald for the automaker.","Lamborghini Terzo Millennio concept electric car unveiled, hints at Lambo's future",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/11/06/lamborghini-terzo-millennio-concept-electric-car-unveiled-hints-at-lambos-future.html

What are we to think when the sacred things of society are disregarded and become the site of evil? Evil seems unavoidable -- even in church.

On Sunday, November 5, 2017, America witnessed the deadliest church shooting in her history. The gunman walked into a house of worship outside San Antonio, Texas and opened fire on members of the congregation.

Is God the author of evil? It is the question that challenges all of us during times of unexplained evil acts. If not God, how then do we explain evil?

ARIZ. AIRPORT FORCED TO REMOVE SEATING OVER BEDBUG INFESTATION

According to The Miami Herald, officials are currently investigating Saturday’s incident, which reportedly took place near a security checkpoint behind an American Airlines ticket counter. In footage the Herald obtained from an anonymous source, the man can be seen walking behind the ticketing desk and diving onto the conveyor belt.

Subsequent footage shows the unidentified man sprinting across the tarmac as airport workers gave chase. He was quickly apprehended by airport staff, and later handcuffed by a police officer who arrived on the scene.

It is currently unknown whether the man was carrying a weapon, but the Herald’s source finds the incident “very concerning” either way.

“Had there been a plane at that gate, this individual could have entered the plane or had access to the aircraft. This is a very restricted area, only accessible to some with very limited access, and he was able to gain access,” said the source.

PASSENGERS HELD AT AIRPORT BECAUSE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS WERE LATE TO WORK

In a statement obtained by Fox News, American Airlines has commended the ""quick actions of our colleagues in Miami who helped alleviate this security issue,"" though they directed any further inquiries to the Miami police.

Miami-Dade Police have yet to reveal the man’s identity, or whether he was a passenger or employee.

By William McGurn, The Wall Street Journal



Imagine you are a sane Democrat who recognizes that a big reason Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in November was that she alienated many members of the white working class. In the year since, you have been working on your fellow Democrats to change their message in hopes of wooing these voters back into the fold. Then a gunman opens fire at a Baptist church in Texas, and suddenly progressives are in full deplorable mode, attacking anyone who dares offer . . . prayers.

This is the extraordinary turn of events since Devin Patrick Kelley turned his rifle on the innocent churchgoers inside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. What provoked the left, if it can really be called a provocation, was President Trump’s statement from Japan Sunday, in which he said that “our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of today’s horrible and murderous attack.” House Speaker Paul Ryan likewise set off the furies by tweeting, “The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now.”

The responses have to be read to be believed. Here’s one of the more charming: “The murdered victims were in a church,” tweeted actor Wil Wheaton to Mr. Ryan. “If prayers did anything, they’d still be alive, you worthless sack of [expletive].”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren chose less inflammatory wording for her own tweet. “Thoughts & prayers are not enough, GOP,” wrote the Massachusetts Democrat. “We must end this violence. We must stop these tragedies. People are dying while you wait.” In short, if you are a Republican praying instead of passing gun control, you’ve got blood on your hands.

The Huffington Post devoted an entire piece to the phenomenon, under the headline “People Fed Up With ‘Thoughts and Prayers’ Demand Action After Texas Church Massacre.” It featured tweets from celebrities and gun-control advocates who believe they had discovered something big: Prayers aren’t always answered.",OPINION: How Dare the GOP Pray for Texas,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/opinion-how-dare-gop-pray-texas#commenting

So it’s just shocking and scary and sad to know that that still exists in our country.”

A post shared by Korie Robertson (@bosshogswife) on May 15, 2017 at 4:26pm PDT

The star went on to explain that she believes people need to constantly be talking about race and acknowledge the large population that believes someone is better than someone else based on the color of their skin. Additionally, she called on the church to lead the charge toward unity.

“I think we need to speak up, and we need to talk about it. Sometimes we kind of just don't talk about it because maybe in some ways we don't know what to say. We don't want to make a mistake. We want to be politically correct, so we just stay silent and hope that it gets better, and that's really not the way to healing,""

Korie and her husband, Willie Robertson, adopted their son Will when he was just five weeks old. They’ve become proponents of adoption and previously told People that their son being biracial hasn’t come up in the way they raise him, only in how the public looks at them.

“Here’s the thing: when we look at him, we don’t see an adopted kid.

Parton addressed the allegations against her longtime publicist on Twitter late Thursday.

""I've worked with Kirt Webster for many years and he has done a wonderful job. I am hoping that the accusations are not true,"" she tweeted.

A rep for Kid Rock told Fox News the singer was no longer working with Webster days after a former client accused Webster of drugging and sexually assaulting him -- a claim Webster denies.

The rocker, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, told us in a statement he takes accusations of sexual assault and mistreatment of others ""dead seriously.""

""I never witnessed or heard about any of this outside that he was probably gay, which I could care less about.

He added, ""I believe sexual harassment is like cancer. We all know someone affected by it and it has to stop.""

Charlie Daniels told Fox News he had fired Webster.

""""I know absolutely nothing about Kirt Webster's personal life and am not by any means qualified to comment on it. All of our ties with Webster and Associates have been severed and I will have no further comment on the situation,"" he said.

A source close to Travis also told Fox News the country legend had dropped Webster.

Fox News was told Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

While several artists have quietly fired Webster, they have not released statements.

Former client Austin Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of abuse at the hands of Webster and a former intern told us Webster propositioned him for sex while at work.

“I completed my review of the DNC and I did find the cancer,” Brazile said she admitted to Sanders in September 2016.
She told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that her critics “can go to hell.” She added: ""I'm going to tell my story.
The reason why so many Democrats wish Brazile would shut up is actually quite clear.
I’ve known Donna Brazile for nearly 20 years, since she became the first female campaign manager for a major party nominee during Al Gore’s 2000 campaign.","Most Democrats are publicly muting their criticism of Donna Brazile, a longtime party operative whose new tell-all book has shaken Washington with its revelations about how the Hillary Clinton campaign took control of the supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee. But privately, they are furious at Brazile’s charges that Clinton controlled the DNC and tilted the primary playing field to help her defeat Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

The book – titled “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdown That Put Donald Trump in the White House” – came out Tuesday, but Brazille released excerpts last week and has been giving media interviews.

Brazile, a longtime Clinton ally, was tapped in mid-2016 to lead the embattled DNC after former chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in July after leaked internal emails showed key members of her staff speaking critically of Bernie Sanders in his primary fight against Clinton.

“I completed my review of the DNC and I did find the cancer,” Brazile said she admitted to Sanders in September 2016. “I explained that the cancer was [Clinton] and [she] had exerted this control of the party long before she became the nominee.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic progressive, when asked on Thursday if the DNC was rigged to favor Clinton, responded with one word: “yes.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, also called the primary “rigged.” She stepped down as a Democratic Party vice chair during the primaries over her frustration with the DNC.

Brazile also said she pondered a move to replace Clinton as the Democratic nominee after the candidate contracted pneumonia, covered up the illness and then collapsed in New York at a 9/11 memorial ceremony.

Robby Mook, the former campaign manager for Clinton, says it is “laughable” that the DNC could have tilted the race to his candidate. He says the controversy should be forgotten.

A group of dozens of other Clinton campaign staffers signed an open letter saying “we do not recognize the campaign she [Brazile] portrays in the book.” The open letter added: “Finally, we are pretty tired of people who were not part of our campaign telling the world what it was like to be on the inside of our campaign and how we felt about it.”

Other staffers are privately depicting Brazile to reporters as “confused” or even “crazy” in telling her story.

Brazile isn’t taking the criticism lying down. She told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that her critics “can go to hell.” She added: ""I'm going to tell my story. Why am I supposed to be the only person who is unable to tell my story?""

The reason why so many Democrats wish Brazile would shut up is actually quite clear. Democrats traditionally paper over any conflicts in their party, and most media outlets cooperate by downplaying tensions – while eagerly portraying any disagreements inside the GOP as a potential “civil war.”

Democrats worry that if the tensions inside their party break out into the open, their carefully constructed coalition of identity groups – from gays to environmentalists to African-Americans – will fray around the edges.

But this time, silence about internal fights isn’t likely to hold. It’s been a year since Clinton lost the presidential election to Donald Trump in a shocking upset. Clinton continues to blame everyone but herself – from Russia, to Bernie Sanders, to then-FBI Director James Comey – for her loss. So it shouldn’t be surprising that frustrated Democrats are finally returning fire.

“A lot of Democrats believe it’s past time for the party to move on beyond the Clintons, and understanding what happened in the 2016 campaign is part of a necessary conversation,” says Doug Schoen, a former adviser to the Clintons in the 1990s and currently a Fox News contributor.

I’ve known Donna Brazile for nearly 20 years, since she became the first female campaign manager for a major party nominee during Al Gore’s 2000 campaign. I have always found her forthright and a cut above traditional political hacks, who will explain away anything inconvenient in their party.

Democrats should recognize that however painful Brazile’s revelations may be in the short term, sweeping them under the rug will only mean they will reemerge in the 2020 campaign as the party’s progressive and pragmatic factions again fight over will control the party.","Donna Brazile, you were absolutely right to tell Democrats to 'go to hell'",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/donna-brazile-were-absolutely-right-to-tell-democrats-to-go-to-hell.html

Scott Ostrem, 47, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and 30 counts of attempted murder. Ostrem was captured Thursday after he allegedly walked into the Walmart in Thornton, a Denver suburb, and began firing his gun, killing a woman and two men. Michelle Willoughby, his stepsister, told The Denver Post that Ostrem has been tormented by voices in his head since he took 16 doses of LSD at a party in 1988.

""When he came home, he was terrified. He had voices in his head. Demons. My brother was freaking out,” Willoughby told The Denver Post. “He was screaming that the devil was after him.”

She added before the drug trip, her stepbrother was a “people person” and someone who she “adored.” But that one bad drug experience changed him forever, she said.

“My brother is not this monster,” Willoughby said. “He is not cold blooded. He hears these voices. Honestly, in my heart, I believe there is only so much a person can take.”

She added: “I never thought something like this would happen.”

Investigators are still looking for a possible motive in the attack. Ostrem was captured fewer than 10 miles away from the store where he allegedly unleashed a rain of bullets. He was spotted by police in his red Mitsubishi driving past an apartment complex they received a tip about that morning.

The victims in the shooting were identified as Pamela Marques, 52, of Denver; Carlos Moreno, 66, of Thornton; and Victor Vasquez, 26, of Denver.

Very little information is known about Ostrem, who abruptly left his job as a sheet metal worker at a roofing company hours before the attack. Neighbors described him as a loner who often seemed angry. A supervisor at the roofing company said he was a quiet and talented worker.

Willoughby said the family tried helping out Ostrem after the 1988 drug incident by contacting a hospital. He underwent a drug intervention but did not get psychological treatment, she said. Ostrem was frequently counseled by a Catholic priest who placed a crucifix on his forehead, commanded demons to leave his body and asked God to silence the voices.

Charles Grob, a psychiatry professor at UCLA, said it is unlikely that LSD would be the cause of a decadeslong psychosis. It was more likely that Ostrem had ""some severe disturbance to begin with,"" he said.

""I don't think LSD is the right culprit,"" Grob said.

Ostrem did not enter a plea when he appeared in court on Monday. He is being held without bail. Adams County District Attorney Dave Young said hate-crime charges have not been ruled out for Ostrem.

But in certain parts of the world, the humble vending machine has taken on a whole other persona, spitting out delicacies (I use that term loosely) the likes of which you’ve never dreamed come out an automated metal contraption.

This is convenience food on a whole other level—and here’s where you can go to find it.

Hairy Crabs, China

The season for consumption of hairy crabs in China is from August to October and, during this time, don’t be surprised if you see a vending machine selling live crabs at selected subway stations across the country.

Yes, that’s right—I said live.

The machine’s cool temperatures apparently keep the crabs in a dormant, sleep-like state, ready for consumption. Along with the spiny delicacy, you also get some crab vinegar and ginger tea thrown into the “crustacean combo meal” too.

Mashed Potato, Singapore

If you’ve ever had a hankering for some late-night mashed potato (on a day other than Thanksgiving), then get yourself down to the nearest Singaporean 7-11 store, pronto.

The “mashed potato” machines, (which are often sitting alongside the soda and Slurpee dispensers), actually spit out a squirt of powdered potato that is mixed with water and then topped with a gravy-like substance.

Mmm...just like Momma used to make.

Salad, USA

Eschewing the usual trend of unhealthy snacks, a certain vending machine company has introduced a range of freshly-made salads and fruit cups.

The machines are currently only available across the greater Chicago area, in markets, hospitals and the airport, but have plans to expand across the country.

The salads, which come in jars, include flavors like cauliflower fried rice, veggies with hummus and huevos rancheros.

Canned Bread, Japan

As odd as this sounds, this is actually one of the least wacky snacks that are available in Japan.

The sweet bread, which has been cooked in the can, comes in several different flavors such as strawberry, blueberry, chocolate and green tea and will often feature popular Japanese cartoon or anime figures on the packaging.

French Fries, Australia

Dispensing chipped potatoes in paper cups, these “Hot Chip” machines can be found in gas stations, food courts and hotel lobbies across Australia.

The fries are apparently cooked fresh in around two minutes, after being deep-fried in a “healthier” bran oil. But let’s be honest, if you’re ordering fries from a vending machine, health is probably the last thing on your mind.

Sausages and Smoked Meats, Germany

Picture the scene: You’re driving home from work and suddenly get hit with a craving for some sliced ham. Never fear, for in Germany, you can simply pull over, insert a few coins into a vending machine and drive home with some ham and sausages within minutes.

Polls show that Americans are deeply divided on whether Trump’s leadership is making America great again.
Perhaps most critically, his election managed to blow up the lives of career politicians – Republicans and Democrats alike – along with their corrupt parties.","A year ago, some 63 million Americans elected Donald Trump to serve as the nation’s 45th president. Few anticipated his improbable success when he launched his campaign. Not the media. Not his 16 Republican opponents. And certainly not Hillary Clinton.

In fact, Trump himself likely never saw it coming.

“This is beyond anybody’s expectations,” he said at Trump Tower in June 2015, marveling at the size of the crowd that had come to watch him kick off his candidacy.

On that unassuming day, Trump laid out exactly what America could expect from him as its president, both in style and substance. As it turns out, he’s given people exactly what he promised – with one glaring exception.

And it’s this exception that may cost him the White House.

Here’s why.

When Trump announced his run, he explained that America required two things of its president and politicians. The first was good leadership, which Trump defined as smart people who simply got stuff done.

The second was inspiration. “We need a cheerleader,” he explained. “We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.”

He fundamentally believed that he couldn’t make America great again by just passing better laws or fairer trade deals. Instead, the country needed to feel great again, too.

By Trump’s telling, America had neither inspiration nor good leadership.

The politicians? Corrupt and ineffective. “They’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests,” he proclaimed.

And their policies? Ruinous. Trump took special aim at unfair trade deals, especially those with China, Mexico, and Japan.

“They come in, they take our jobs, they take our money… and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest,” Trump explained in disbelief.

“How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?”

Trump targeted the usual suspects of failed leadership – Obama and Clinton – but also added Republicans, too, such as former President Bush and opponents like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

He promised to be different.

“We need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote 'The Art of the Deal.'”

Trump’s self-promotion underlined his belief in the second key requirement for successful presidents – inspiration.

His “improvement of the brand” may have sounded different than normal politician-speak – more calculated, less lofty – but arguably was of the same cloth. He fundamentally believed that he couldn’t make America great again by just passing better laws or fairer trade deals. Instead, the country needed to feel great again, too.

America needed a Cheerleader-in-Chief.

To demonstrate how important this was to Trump, he held up Obama as a cautionary tale. The president explained that Obama was – when first elected – a “vibrant” man who possessed a “great spirit” that the country needed.

But, he warned, that vibrant spirit eventually became a “negative force” that divided the nation.

Fast forward from Trump’s campaign launch to the completion of his first year in office.

How’s he doing?

Polls show that Americans are deeply divided on whether Trump’s leadership is making America great again. Domestically, supporters point to a strong economy, robust stock market, and efforts to remake bad trade deals. He’s also tried to dump ObamaCare, change immigration policies, and re-write the tax code (with mixed results).

On foreign matters, supporters highlight a more aggressive stance against Iran, North Korea, and ISIS. He’s also pulled out of the Paris climate accord that was opposed by many of his supporters.

Perhaps most critically, his election managed to blow up the lives of career politicians – Republicans and Democrats alike – along with their corrupt parties.

In short, it’s hard to argue that Trump isn’t delivering on his definition of presidential leadership, especially the face of deeply critical media coverage.

But Trump’s leadership is only half of what he claimed would make a successful president. What of his ability to inspire America to feel great again?

Is Trump the Cheerleader-in-Chief the nation needed?

Polling from Fox News suggests not. Even supportive Republicans find his public behavior – the Twitter fights, bragging, and truth-stretching – to be unhelpful or even distasteful. Additional polling from GOP-friendly Rasmussen Reports also shows that the country still believes it’s on the wrong track a year after Trump’s election.

But forget polling. Criticism of Trump’s personality is not new, even to Trump himself. He knows that his brash style is his Achilles’ heel. In fact, he said as much when he launched his campaign in 2015.

“You’re not a nice person,” Trump said, quoting a reporter who described him. “How can you get people to vote for you?”

His response to the criticism was telling.

“This is going to be an election that’s based on competence, because people are tired of these ‘nice’ people [politicians]. And they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.”

In other words, Trump knew that people might not like him. Still, he gambled that Americans would ultimately tolerate an ill-tempered New Yorker so long as he could browbeat the dysfunctional House and Senate into fixing America’s brokenness.

His gamble paid off. He won the presidency.

A year later, the question is whether he can keep it.

What Trump’s gamble failed to consider is that while voters might be willing to stomach his sharp-elbowed style, the Senators and Representatives he needs to advance his MAGA agenda are not. It’s no surprise, then, that Democrats (and restive Republicans) are clamoring for a way to bring Trump down.

The main avenue to do so appears to be encouraging Robert Mueller’s investigation into the alleged collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Others cling to the increasingly dubious “Russian dossier” of tawdry (and largely discredited, unproven, and partisan) allegations.

But the truth is that Trump-haters don’t need Mueller or the Russian dossier. They simply need to prevent Trump from advancing his agenda – demonstrating his promised competence to the American people – all while baiting him into the next distasteful Twitter fight.

They’re molding him as the next Obama.

They’re making him the very negative force he campaigned against.

Fresh polling shows that this dynamic is already happening, and at a shocking rate. The American people – Democrats and Independents in particular – disapprove of Trump at levels unseen in some 70 years.

The trajectory of Trump’s presidency is becoming clear. If Trump remains deeply unpopular, Democrats may win back the House and Senate in 2018 (though polling shows trouble for them too). Should progressives win, the dam holding back charges of impeachment will likely burst.

Whether Trump actually colluded with Russia or not will be politically irrelevant (even if legally and morally paramount) when Nancy Pelosi’s party takes over. After all, impeachment is a vote of politics, not of legal guilt or innocence.

Even if Trump isn’t impeached, Americans will still be exhausted by four years of D.C. drama. It’s hard to see how Trump and fellow Republicans escape ownership of that turmoil.

Our 45th leader is thus at a crossroads. If he wants to survive until January of 2020 (and beyond), he must chart a course back to June of 2015. It was at that year’s campaign launch where he correctly explained that a successful presidency is both parts competence and inspiration.

The sharp elbows and Twitter fights may have helped him reach the Oval Office but it is not what will keep him there. That will take a notable transition into a more credible Cheerleader-in-Chief. Fundamentally, that means turning off the self-promotion and Twitter account and turning on what President Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.

Humility. Gratitude. Forgiveness.

Can Trump find his better angels? Time will tell, of course. But one thing’s clear.

Sixty-three million Americans put their faith in a man to change the course of the nation.

Brazile, former interim DNC chair, pulled no punches in going after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’ leadership style. In her book “Hacks,” released Tuesday, Brazile recalled how she was briefed upon taking over for Schultz on the many perks meant to keep the chair “fat and happy” – including a “big Tahoe SUV” with a driver, a “body woman” and more.

“Debbie had a chief of staff and a body woman. She also had media consultants and a fund-raising consultant. I was free to hire my own consultants, two or three if I liked, and bring in a new communications team. All of that would go on the DNC payroll,” she wrote.

Brazile was briefed on all these benefits by the liaison with Clinton’s campaign. Brazile wrote that she told him she’d sell the SUV and drive herself, and would not hire consultants.

“And God knows I didn’t need a body woman,” she wrote.

BRAZILE LEVELS SEXISM ACCUSATION AGAINST CLINTON TOP DOG

She voiced surprise at the spending considering she was informed “the party was broke and $2 million in debt” when she took over, with the party spending upwards of $4 million a month. Stripping the extra expenses was “one way of getting the burn rate down,” she wrote, questioning how many “hangers-on and sycophants were draining the lifeblood out of this party.”

Brazile’s book sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party last week after the allegation first surfaced that the DNC had struck a special deal with the Clinton campaign, giving it partial control over party resources while the campaign helped with the DNC’s troubled finances.

Brazile suggested that the perks helped fuel this situation.

“This was the way to keep the chair fat and happy: Give her a huge staff and lots of perks and don’t ask her to do anything,” she wrote.

Early book excerpts also revealed that Brazile considered trying to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee amid questions about Clinton's health -- and included allegations of sexism against some campaign officials.

Clinton campaign members have fired back at Brazile’s account. An open letter signed by dozens of team members said: “Donna came in to take over the DNC at a very difficult time. We were grateful to her for doing so. She is a longtime friend and colleague of many of us and has been an important leader in our party.

“[But], look, if somebody’s got Paul Newman in ‘The Verdict,’ I’d jump,” he said. “But there aren’t that many like that. Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f-----g dollars. I don’t need money.”

Back in June, Clooney confirmed that he and his business partners – nightlife businessman Rande Gerber and real estate mogul Mike Meldeman – sold their tequila company Casamigos for $1 billion.

“I have money,” said Clooney. “So I can fight to make movies I want to make. If you look at what I’ve been in over the past 15 years, for the most part they weren’t going to get made if I didn’t do them. Nobody was going to make ‘Good Night, and Good Luck,’ ‘Michael Clayton’ or ‘Up in the Air,’ and I fought to get those out there.”

Clooney admitted the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he’s not ready to tackle that role.

“So many people since Trump was elected have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,” he explained. “I don’t have political aspirations.”

He added, “I have always been involved in politics. My father ran for Congress. It’s been in our family forever. But, mostly, I can help in ways I actually know very well, like messaging [voters].”",George Clooney explains why he's taking a break from acting: 'I don't need money',http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/george-clooney-explains-why-hes-taking-break-from-acting-dont-need-money.html

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

Service dogs are not pets.
Service dogs for those with post-traumatic stress disorder are often on point, keeping potential triggers that would raise stress or anxiety levels for their veterans at bay.
Service dogs are not pets.
So far, we’ve just addressed how people react to service dogs.","The relationship between a service dog and a veteran is akin to a team walking a tightrope. To succeed, they must focus on each other, intently. Distract one, and both can stumble. When they are in sync, the intricate teamwork going on can appear effortless to the outside world. And this partly explains why some people, often quite innocently, insist on being a distraction. Hence the ubiquitous question:

Can I pet your dog?

Uh, no, not now. Not ever. Keep your paws off, please.

Would you want someone to ask if they could rub your heart surgeon’s head while she was operating on you? Would you think it appropriate if someone offered to rub your lawyer’s belly while he was trying to convince a jury of your innocence?

Probably not, right? You'd think these were grossly inappropriate questions and certainly needless distractions in the midst of critical, sometimes life and death, situations.

And that’s exactly how you should think about service dogs when they are about their work. Note the key word: work.

But that’s the thing. Service dogs are not pets. When their vest is on, they have an extremely important job to do.

In public, vest on, these dogs are engaged in life-saving tasks for their veterans. Guide dogs prevent blind or vision-impaired veterans from wandering into the street when a light is red. For veterans with prosthetic limbs, their dogs open doors, keep watch for things easily tripped over, or act as a brace when vets are walking or standing up. Service dogs for those with post-traumatic stress disorder are often on point, keeping potential triggers that would raise stress or anxiety levels for their veterans at bay. For veterans prone to seizures, their dogs will alert them if they sense an episode coming on.

We get it. These dogs are irresistibly cute. And clearly just the sight of one in a store or restaurant can turn normally reserved adults into children. Disabled veterans have seen grown men crawl under tables, barking to get a dog’s attention. And while they’re down there, may as well pet the pup, right? If it were them, they’d no doubt welcome having their meal interrupted so people could show their pet some love.

But that’s the thing. Service dogs are not pets. When their vest is on — the garment often emblazoned with the words “Service dog: Do not pet” — they have an extremely important job to do. They have undergone months, sometimes years, of intense training that costs tens of thousands of dollars — an expense currently not covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They are there to watch for and react to dangerous situations and await commands from their veterans. If you call to these dogs, or insist on talking to them, then, despite all that training — they are, after all, still dogs — they are potentially paying attention to you, not the veterans they are supposed to serve and protect. In other words, you’re bouncing up and down on their tightrope.

Think about it this way: If the service dog turns its head or body to see what you want, the veteran with vision loss could wind up stumbling and falling. Prosthetic limbs can be seriously damaged in the twists and turns of a tumble. Or the dog might not catch the early signs of a seizure, or miss something that causes problems for a vet with PTSD.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) actually requires owners to maintain control of their animals. Don’t make a tough job more difficult.

So far, we’ve just addressed how people react to service dogs. But their behavior toward disabled vets can be even more bizarre — and quite rude. For example, people often say, “I know it’s a service dog and he’s working, so I won’t pet him.” This is so irritating. It’s as if they are magnanimously making the decision to pet or not pet without asking prior permission. An analogy would be: “I know you have a purse and I know I am not to steal it, so I won’t.” How generous.

Worse is when people just reach out to pet a service dog, seemingly from every direction imaginable. Then they will get angry when the surprised disabled veteran turns and says, “Please don’t pet him, he’s working.” Their disturbing response? “Well, what’s wrong with you? You don’t look disabled.” People seem to genuinely believe they have a right to know this. (Maybe so they can decide in their own mind if it’s OK to pet the animal with the vest that clearly says “Do not pet”?)

That’s just wrong. There is never a need for a stranger to know a veteran’s medical history. In fact, the ADA doesn’t even allow staff in stores or restaurants to ask people with a service animal what their disability is. They are permitted two questions: Is the service animal required because of a disability? and What work or task has it been trained to perform? If veterans don’t have to disclose their disabilities in those situations, why would they ever make themselves vulnerable by blurting it out to strangers on the street?

The disabled veteran community has a slogan, Paws Off Please (POP), designed to educate people about interacting with the service animals that are becoming more and more commonplace in public. So, lesson one: If a dog has a vest on, that means it’s working; don’t pay attention to it.

But, please, don’t ever ignore the veterans. Instead, be sure to thank them for their service.

Democrats have worked feverishly all year to make nearly every local election a referendum on President Trump – and Tuesday's gubernatorial races are no exception.

The Trump factor looms large in the marquee Virginia gubernatorial race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and his allies have churned out mailers and ads tying Republican rival Ed Gillespie to the Trump White House at every turn.

The Trump-referendum strategy has not been particularly successful for Democrats in the House special elections so far this year. But this time, polls in New Jersey and Virginia’s gubernatorial races show the Democratic candidates in the lead.

In New Jersey, Democratic nominee Phil Murphy holds a substantial lead over Republican Kim Guadagno.

But the race in Virginia is considerably tighter. According to the latest Fox News Poll released Monday, Northam holds a 5-point edge over Gillespie, who says there is “no doubt” the polls are close.

In the final stretch, Gillespie questioned whether the Democrats' Trump-all-the-time strategy is a sound one.","Election Day: Trump Factor Looms Large in Virginia, New Jersey Governor's Races",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/election-day-trump-factor-looms-large-virginia-new-jersey-governors-races#commenting

The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.

I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.

How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.

An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.

Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.

Here’s what to do next.

Establish two-factor authentication

If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.

The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.

Who allows 2FA?

Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.

Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.

But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.

You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:

· Bank of America

· Capital One

· Discover

· USAA

· Wells Fargo

If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.

Prevent identity theft

OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?

Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.

How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.

Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.

The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

Nobody was going to make ‘Good Night, and Good Luck,’ ‘Michael Clayton’ or ‘Up in the Air,’ and I fought to get those out there.”

Clooney admitted the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he’s not ready to tackle that role.

“So many people since Trump was elected have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,” he explained. “I don’t have political aspirations.”

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

The disease is contracted by breathing in a mist or vapor contaminated with the Legionella bacteria, which can grow in cooling towers, showers, spas, hot tubs and other water sources. It is not transmitted directly from person to person.

This article originally appeared on Newser: One Snub of Hitler May Have Changed History","A snub appears to have led Adolf Hitler to the Nazi party. A historian is making the case that the most reviled dictator in history first tried to join the German Socialist party but was rejected, the Guardian reports.

If the German Socialists, another far right party, had taken him, Hitler may have settled for a more minor role in the party, which was larger than the Nazis, argues Thomas Weber.

Since Hitler hadn't previously ""shown any leadership qualities and had been happy to follow orders,"" Weber says he may not have ever risen to prominence. ""The Nazi party would have been absorbed by the German Socialist party and thus would have disappeared and history would have taken a different path,"" Weber tells the Guardian.

If that happened, it's unlikely there would have been World War II or the Holocaust, Weber tells the Independent. Weber, of the University of Aberdeen, found an overlooked document from 1919 in a Munich archive showing the German Socialists told Hitler not only that he wasn't welcome as a member, but that he couldn't write for the party paper.

Hitler went on to join the Nazis and became its leader in 1921. The German Socialist party was dissolved the following year. Weber writes in in his upcoming book that the ""erratic doings of a prima donna"" attributed to Hitler belied a ""skillful and conniving political operator"" who ""kept a lifelong vengeance"" against his enemies.

So why did the German Socialists spurn Hitler? Weber tells the Independent that perhaps ""it had something to do with the fact Hitler was opinionated and they did not want to have someone there who was telling them what to do."" (The Dutch Red Cross admits a ""painful"" WWII truth.)

Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, the theoretical physicist said AI has the potential to be the best or worst thing humanity has ever seen and the scary reality is we just don’t know which yet.

“We cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it,” he said.

The Cambridge professor said while AI could be hugely beneficial for reducing poverty, disease and restoring the natural environment, it’s impossible to predict “what we might achieve when our own minds are amplified by AI”.

“AI could be the worst invention of the history of our civilization, that brings dangers like powerful autonomous weapons or new ways for the few to oppress the many.”

“AI could develop a will of its own, a will that is in conflict with ours and which could destroy us. In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity.”

Addressing the crowd of engineers and tech workers at the “vanguard” of AI development, Hawking warned they needed to focus on maximizing benefits for society rather than pure capability.

“We need to employ effective management in all areas of its development,” he said. “We stand on a threshold of a brave new world. It is an exciting, if precarious place to be and you are the pioneers.”

The address set the scene for three days of talks between high-profile tech, business and government leaders grappling with ethical implications of everything from self-driving cars to sex dolls.

Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrove called tech’s current crossroads the “kind of inflection point that happens once in several lifetimes.” High-profile speakers including United Nations Secretary General Antonito Guterres and European Union’s commissioner for Competition Margarethe Vestager also took the stage on Monday and joined calls for an ethical approach that reduces inequality.

Kernel founder Bryan Johnson, who has plowed $100 million into his company to “hack the human brain,” agrees we’re on the threshold of the “most consequential revolution in the history of the human race.”

“The future is like a Category 5 hurricane that’s going to bear down on us with so much force the single greatest thing we can do as a species is work on our adaptability to change,” he said.

The European Union’s competition commissioner Vestager, who has fined Apple $19 billion over unpaid taxes in Ireland and Google $3.6 billion for disadvantaging others with its algorithm, said the main challenge for governments is to develop the tools to keep up with the rapid pace of change.

“We have to take our democracy back and renew it, because society is about people and not about technology,” she said. “You cannot just say what happens in the black box stays in the black box.”

The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.

The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI’s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – making Fusion’s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.

The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. At that time, Fox News has learned that bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.

But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom, a confidential source told Fox News. Court records reviewed by Fox News, email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair’s presence together. The source told Fox News they also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.

""What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington."" - Marc Thiessen, former Bush Administration official

Simpson’s presence with Veselnitskaya during this critical week in June -- together with revelations about Fusion’s simultaneous financial ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign and Russian interests -- raise new questions about the company’s role in the 2016 election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Trump Tower meeting as part of his probe of Russian interference in last year’s election.

Simpson and Fusion GPS were hired by BakerHostetler, which represented Russian firm Prevezon through Veselnitskaya.

Veselnitskaya has said she sought the Trump Tower meeting in order to lobby the candidate’s team against Russian sanctions, but the initial approach included an offer of compromising information on candidate Clinton.

Lawyers representing Fusion and Veselnitskaya did not respond to requests for comment lodged on Friday.

Senate Judiciary Committee investigators interviewed Simpson for more than 10 hours on Aug. 22. A spokesman for the committee had no comment on whether Simpson confirmed his contact with Veselnitskaya during the closed-door session.

The DNC and Clinton campaign hired Fusion in April 2016 through lawyer Marc Elias, who was general counsel for the Clinton campaign. Fusion, in turn, paid Steele $168,000 for the dossier, memos from which were shared with the FBI in the summer of 2016.

Fusion officials said last week Steele's money came from $1.02 million it received in fees and expenses from Elias' law firm Perkins Coie. Prior to contracting with the DNC, Fusion had been conducting research into Trump and other Republican candidates on behalf of the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon.

NBC News first reported that Veselnitskaya and Simpson were both at a hearing centered around another Fusion client, Russian oligarch Denis Katsyv. His company, Prevezon Holdings, was sanctioned against doing business in the U.S. for its alleged role in laundering more than $230 million. Fox News obtained audio records from that hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

The wrongdoing had been uncovered by Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested for probing Prevezon and other companies with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In December 2012, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act was passed into U.S. law, freezing Russian assets and banning visas for sanctioned individuals. Fusion’s Simpson is believed to have been working with Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet counter-intelligence officer turned Russian-American lobbyist, to overturn the sanctions.

Akhmetshin also attended the June 9 Trump Tower meeting, along with about a half-dozen others including Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, publicist Rob Goldstone, Natalia's Russian translator Anatoli Samochornov and Ike Kaveladze from a Russian-American real estate agency.

Mueller’s interest in Fusion is unclear, but the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of several related congressional probes, recently struck a deal to gain access to Fusion’s bank records after initially issuing a subpoena. The records show that the DNC funded Fusion’s dossier effort.

Over the weekend, Fusion GPS sought a new restraining order after the House panel requested additional records that could reveal if Fusion was paying media companies or reporters for planting stories.

""What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington,"" Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former Bush administration official, said. ""It's going into Hlilary Clinton. It's going to Fusion GPS. It's going into a lobbying campaign up on Capitol Hill against Magnitsky.""

Meanwhile, a request from Veselnitskaya and Katsyv for a new ""temporary immigration parole"" to return to the U.S. for a Nov. 9 Prevezon hearing in New York was denied, according to court documents reviewed by Fox News.

A Senate Judiciary Committee spokesman told Fox News they are ""encouraged"" that Veselnitskaya has ""signaled a willingness to cooperate"" with the committee.

By the end, both daddy and daughter are screaming through the desert in their red sedan as an upbeat song blasts in the background.

Critics, however, weren’t so thrilled with Coke’s timing. While some praised the ad as a celebration of Saudi Arabia’s recent order to overturn its decades-old driving ban on women, others accused Coke of exploiting the historic ruling to turn a profit.

SURVEY SAYS KENDALL JENNER'S PEPSI AD DIDN'T HURT COMPANY'S IMAGE

Another Twitter user likened the ad to a recent Pepsi commercial which featured Kendall Jenner breaking up a police protest by offering one of the officers a soda. Pepsi later pulled the ad in the wake of accusations that they were capitalizing off the wave of police protests and making light of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Coke has yet to issue a statement in regard to the controversy, though they might be wise to ignore it altogether: After Pepsi’s controversial ad with Kendall Jenner aired in early April, a marketing firm found that a majority of survey participants saw Pepsi in a more favorable light after viewing the ad.

The New York Post also reports that Coke plans to open a $100 million bottling plant in Saudi Arabia sometime in 2019.

Sometimes it’s the unassuming gesture that makes the most profound impact on your life.

We never set out to build a museum for the Bible. We were happy raising our children and helping to run the family business.

We thought that someone else was going to put the museum together, and we were content to acquire items, then donate them to the museum.

Little did we know that when we agreed to help acquire a biblical artifact, our future had changed.

It is astounding that so many people from different parts of the world—people of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and languages—all meet up around one book that was written thousands of years ago.

We had to ask ourselves, “What would it look like for us to keep the dream alive and work toward building a museum to house all these wonderful ancient biblical artifacts?” That thought was, honestly, overwhelming.

But the deeper question we had to ask and answer for ourselves was, “What does it mean for us to take this journey?”

The answer to that question is the premise for our new book, ""This Dangerous Book."" It’s an answer that unfolds like an archaeological dig, layers upon layers removed until the experience of discovery makes us smile in delight.

We discovered how precious these artifacts are. They are also precious to all kinds of people, all over the world.

So many people of different faith traditions have pulled us aside and expressed their gratitude for this project.

It’s one of the most rewarding aspects of our journey in building a museum.

We’ve found a remarkable sense of unity around this ancient text. That excites and inspires us.

Holding up the Bible as this wonderful human treasure invites people of all walks of life to come and see, explore, and discover this gift of history.

It is astounding that so many people from different parts of the world—people of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and languages—all meet up around one book that was written thousands of years ago.

At the same time, we recognize that today in America, the Bible does not possess the same centrality that it did at our country’s founding.

Journalist and author Kenneth Briggs observes, “For more and more Americans, the Bible has become a museum exhibit, hallowed as a treasure but enigmatic and untouched. Snippets of its languages still pop up occasionally in political speeches. But overall, the Bible is overridden by consumer appetites and a growing array of lifestyles that . . . offer ways of thinking about life, love, and work that have left the Bible behind.”

We believe, however, that this is only partially true of our culture. It may be that we are simply not as skeptical as Mr. Briggs, but our observation is that yes, although our culture does not know the Bible as it once did, there is real longing to know it better.

We can all, as a nation and as collective humanity, observe, appreciate, study, and discuss this book. So much wonder and mystery surrounds not only the Bible itself, as a cultural artifact, but also its claims, its narrative, and its ultimate message.

Our journey with the museum reminds us how God leads us with a journey in mind. We were working for our family business and trying to help some others in their worthy endeavor.

As the collection grew, the family started feeling the responsibility of it. We had been entrusted with the items, and we felt we needed to be sure the dream of a museum became a reality.

The idea was not new to the family; my brother had mentioned more than once over the years the idea of building a Bible museum. He was building a chain of Christian bookstores and carried one of the largest selections of Bibles available.

So little by little, we embraced the dream.

One of the first ideas as a result was opening a traveling exhibit. I (Steve) have said that we, my family, are not collectors. My dad operates by the philosophy that if you buy a new shirt, an old shirt has to go. We were acquiring artifacts not because we were collectors but because we wanted to tell their story.

The problem was, our closet was getting full, and we had no idea when we would be opening a museum. We had no location or date; it was only a dream at the time. That’s when the idea for a traveling exhibit was birthed. We could start telling the incredible story of the items we had acquired, while the idea of the museum developed.

Toward the end of 2010, we had a two-day planning meeting for a Bible exhibit. We wanted to open the exhibit in 2011, launching it with the celebration of the four-hundredth anniversary of the King James Version of the Bible. The King James Version is the most printed version of the Bible, and we thought that would be a great opportunity to launch an exhibit.

In 2011, we successfully opened our U.S. version of a traveling exhibit at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art.

This was the beginning of a journey, a journey with an unknown destination. Not too long after we opened the Oklahoma City exhibit, through some contacts at American Bible Society, discussions began about having an exhibit at the Vatican. We had just finished a race to open the first exhibit, and now the race was on again, as the desired opening for the exhibit at the Vatican was during the lenten season of 2012. We successfully opened the exhibit for the lenten season, which was the first of other international exhibits to come.

Before the museum opened, we had also traveled to Jerusalem, Argentina, Cuba, and Germany. We also traveled to several universities across the U.S., with exhibits of varying sizes.

Over the next five years, the exhibit traveled to five cities total, with its last tour ending in 2016 in Santa Clarita, California. It had grown from a fifteen-thousand-square-foot exhibit in Oklahoma City to a forty-thousand-square-foot exhibit before it was closed.

Back in 2011, none of this had been in sight.

Steve and Jackie provide unique insight and commentary into the Bible’s role in our culture and in their personal life. Since 2009 they have been planning for the presentation of various archaeological finds pertaining to the Bible and the world’s most impressive display of materials relating to the Bible’s original writings, its preservation, and its distribution around the globe.

British pianist James Rhodes tweeted a newspaper clipping from The Mirror Saturday in which the Irish star revealed she was ready to quit acting because both producers and directors reportedly claimed she was “a cold potato without sex appeal"" after she refused to sleep with them.

O’Hara, who was nicknamed “The Queen of Technicolor,” appeared in major blockbusters, including 1941’s “How Green Was My Valley,” 1947’s “Miracle on 34th Street,” and 1952’s “The Quiet Man” opposite John Wayne.

“I am so upset with it that I am ready to quit Hollywood,” said the then-25-year-old. “It’s got so bad I hate to come to work in the morning. I’m a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don’t let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread word around town that I am not a woman – that I am a cold piece of marble statuary.”

O’Hara added, “I guess Hollywood won’t consider me as anything except a cold hunk of marble until I divorce my husband, give my baby away and get my name and photograph in all the newspapers. If that’s Hollywood’s idea of being a woman I’m ready to quit now.”

That wouldn’t be the last time O’Hara spoke out about the price of fame. Back in 2004, O’Hara told The Telegraph she never regretted standing up to the men who ran Hollywood’s most notable studios.

“I wouldn’t throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts,” she explained. “I wasn’t going to play the whore. That wasn’t me.”

O’Hara still had a lasting career as a leading lady. By the 1960s, she was ready for retirement. In 1968, she married Gen. Charles F. Blair and the couple lived in St. Croix.

“I was happier with Charlie than I’d ever been in Hollywood,” she recalled. “We had a great life.”

However, the romance ended in tragedy. In 1978, Blair died in a plane crash. O’Hara took over the duty of operating Antilles Air Boats, a small Caribbean airline that her late husband previously ran. She also chose to keep herself busy by taking on a few, selective film roles until 2000 when she made her last screen appearance in the TV movie “The Last Dance.”

Trump keeps attacking Hillary Clinton. Hillary, on her endless book tour, keeps attacking Trump. Donna Brazile is attacking Hillary, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Robby Mook and Jennifer Palmieri, and leading Democrats are attacking Brazile for prolonging the agony of their defeat.

“For those who are telling me to shut up…go to hell,” the former interim DNC chair told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos.

Why are the media lapping this all up? Why is there still so much public interest in the last election? Why does it feel like the country hasn’t moved on?

At a similar point in their presidencies, Barack Obama wasn’t talking about John McCain. George W. Bush wasn’t talking about Al Gore. Bill Clinton wasn’t talking about George H.W. Bush. And Bush 41 wasn’t talking about Michael Dukakis. Sure, presidents always blame their predecessors for leaving them a mess, but they don’t relitigate the election.

What happened on Nov. 8, 2016 was an earthquake in which the favored Clinton dynasty lost and a bombastic billionaire with no political experience won. But it also gets dragged back into the headlines because of Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

Now Trump continues to use Clinton as a foil, but has drawn plenty of flak for repeatedly urging the Justice Department to investigate “Crooked Hillary” for past controversies. And she remains a prime target for conservative media.

Clinton uses her book interviews to keep bashing the president, which keeps her in the news and probably boosts book sales.

(She also pointed to “media guilt” on the “Daily Show,” saying journalists have told her they felt free to beat up on her because they thought she would win anyway. I doubt that was a widespread view, and her problem was that Trump did hundreds of campaign interviews while the ultra-cautious Democrat did very few.)

Now Brazile has ripped the scabs off with “Hacks,” a scorched-earth book in which she rips Clinton and her team, even calling former campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri the B-word. What’s more, she argues that the Clinton camp made her feel like a “slave.”

Brazile can say whatever she wants, but she’s also trying to distance herself from the 2016 debacle by charging that the Hillary team tilted the playing field in essentially taking over the DNC’s daily operations. And there’s some attempted image rehab, given that Brazile lost her gigs at CNN and ABC for twice leaking CNN’s planned debate questions to the Hillary side.

Many Democrats are furious, and more than 100 former Clinton aides signed a letter saying “we are pretty tired of people who were not part of our campaign telling the world what it was like to be on the inside of our campaign and how we felt about it.” The letter also accuses Brazile of buying into “false Russian-fueled propaganda” about Hillary’s health, given Donna’s claim that after a fainting spell she considered pushing Joe Biden as a replacement for Clinton.

All this might be consigned to the dustbin of history. But Democrats, trying to figure out how to take over the House in 2018, are still fighting over lessons from the last war.","2016 redux: Why Trump, Clinton and Brazile keep refighting the last war",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/07/2016-redux-why-trump-clinton-and-brazile-keep-refighting-last-war.html

Florida Blue said Monday that starting Jan. 1, 2018, it will no longer cover the cost of OxyContin, or oxycodone, prescriptions and instead offer patients Xtampza ER. That drug turns into a gel when crushed, so it cannot be easily snorted or smoked. Further, when Xtampza is crushed it releases a substance, known as an opioid antagonist, that minimizes the effect of the opioid.

“Most physicians, most plans have had a hands-off approach for a number of years, and we see where we are now,” Scott McClelland, Florida Blue’s vice president of commercial and specialty pharmacy, told the Miami Herald. “We think it’s time for more people, including physicians in our community, the nurses, even the families to take a more proactive approach in trying to manage this epidemic.”

McClelland added that the switch is part of a new approach Florida Blue is taking to combat the rising abuse of opioids in the country. In May, Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced a statewide public emergency and, more recently, federal officials declared a national opioid overdose epidemic.

“The individuals struggling with drug use are sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and friends and each tragic case leaves loved ones searching for answers and praying for help,” Scott said. “Families across our nation are fighting the opioid epidemic and Florida is going to do everything possible to help our communities.”

Nationally, more than 52,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015 and that number has been rising drastically in recent years. More than half those deaths involve prescription opioids.

In Florida, opioids killed 2,538 people in 2015 and contributed to the deaths of 1,358 other people.

McClelland thinks that prescribing Xtampza ER instead of OxyContin will not only curtail the rampant number of overdose deaths, but also have an effect on street prices.

“It makes the street value a lot less because it’s harder to manipulate,” McClelland said.

Florida Blue’s latest move follows in the footsteps of its 2015 policy that requires prior authorization for all oxycodone prescriptions of more than seven days. That policy, the company says, led to a 20 percent reduction in the use of long-term opioids by members over 12 months.

Other insurance companies have also taken steps to replace OxyContin prescriptions with Xtampza ER, with Cigna announcing in October that it would stop covering the former.

While Purdue Pharma, which manufactures OxyContin, says it supports limiting the supply of the drug, the company added that Florida Blue’s policy will make it tougher for doctors to address addiction among their patients and that Xtampza ER comes with its own potential for abuse.

“Florida Blue’s decision limits prescribers’ options to help address the opioid crisis,” Danielle Lewis, a Purdue Pharma spokeswoman, said in an email to the Herald. “Further, while both products are formulated with properties designed to deter intranasal [snorting] and intravenous [injection] abuse, neither is abuse proof.”","Florida insurer to stop covering oxycodone, will offer abuse-resistant alternative",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/07/florida-insurer-to-stop-covering-oxycodone-will-offer-abuse-resistant-alternative.html

""[I] went to the row and witnessed the lady in the man's lap performing fellatio,” said a passenger who gave a witness statement. “They had a blanket partially covering the 'act.' I asked for boarding cards and names.""

At that point, the witness says the woman sat up in her seat, while the man attempted to apologize.

Police also said that the 48-year-old woman was reported to be “highly intoxicated” when they were dispatched to bring her and the 28-year-old into custody. Police had previously said the two were strangers before boarding the plane; she switched seats sometime into the flight to sit beside him.

Upon the flight’s arrival at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, officers say the man attempted to explain that the woman had merely ""fallen asleep in his lap but that they did not have intercourse,"" and added that he only ""grabbed her breasts on the outside of her clothes.""

The two were taken into custody by the Wayne Metro Detroit Police Department, but were ultimately issued citations by the FBI for lewd and lascivious behavior, police confirmed.

The couple was not formally charged with any crimes, the Detroit Free Press reports.

After the incident, the Press says the woman attempted to re-book her flight with Delta, but the airline stated that she “was not permitted to fly” with them. She left the next day on a different carrier.

The media spent all day after the attack rhetorically asking whether now was the time for more gun control. CNN’s Jim Acosta repeatedly asked if President Trump is, “Content . . . with these mass shootings exploding every month or so.”

Today, the day after the shooting, we know some more about the killer. We now know that one of the victims who attended the church was his ex-mother-in-law. That his conviction was for cracking the skull of his infant son years ago. That he had a “bad conduct” discharge from the military.

If the media waited even a few hours, they would have learned that their calls for regulations — primarily for “universal” background checks — wouldn’t have stopped this attack. Indeed, their proposals wouldn’t have stopped any of the other mass public shootings in the last couple decades. Kelley bought a gun at a gun store, and he passed the background check that the store conducted on him. Lying on the form doesn’t help you evade the computer background check.

Others on MSNBC immediately called for limiting magazine capacities, but a magazine is just a box with a spring in it. They can be made with very simple tools, and now-a-days 3D printers make it an even easier project. We still don’t know if Kelley planned this attack long in advance, though he bought the gun back in April 2016. It is very common for killers to plan mass public shootings one or two years in advance. It's not serious to think that a ban is going to keep anyone other than law-abiding people from obtaining a magazine.

During his press conference early Monday morning in Japan, President Trump worried that the attack was the result of a ""mental health problem at the highest level"" and called the gunman a, “very deranged individual.” Kelley may well have been suffering from a mental illness, but mental health evaluations shouldn’t be counted for much help. Psychiatrists and psychologists have an extremely poor track record in identifying those who pose a threat to others. Half of the mass public shooters of the Obama years were seeing mental health professionals prior to their attacks. None of these experts identified the killers as a danger to others.

Elliot Rodger, who killed six and injured 14 others near the University of California at Santa Barbara, fooled not only sheriff’s deputies but also the internationally-known Dr. Charles Sophy. Sophy is medical director for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. That ought to give people pause before they assume that there’s an easy solution for identifying dangerous individuals.

We know that the attack at the Texas church could have been even worse if it wasn’t for an armed civilian. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, “A local resident grabbed his rifle and engaged the suspect, the suspect dropped his rifle and fled from the church.”

Something should be done, but the question is what. Texas lets each church decide whether to allow permitted concealed handguns, and we don’t know whether this particular church allowed it. What we do know is that time is crucial. The longer it takes for someone to arrive at the scene with a gun, the more people who will be harmed.

If the media and politicians want to do something effective, they could take a page out of Israel’s playbook. When there is a surge in terrorist attacks , Israeli police call on permitted civilians to make sure that they have their guns with them at all times.

Police tend to support an increase in permits. “What would help most in preventing large-scale shootings in public?” PoliceOne asked its 450,000 American officer members in 2013. The most common answer: “More permissive concealed carry policies for civilians.”

Eighty percent of the surveyed officers believed that allowing permitted concealed handguns would reduce the number of victims of mass public shootings.

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

Don’t be tempted to do the job yourself — unless you’re a trained electrician, always hire a professional to do electrical work in your home.",9 pro tips for choosing kitchen lighting,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/9-pro-tips-for-choosing-kitchen-lighting.html

Briskman's face was not visible in the photo, but she claimed she immediately confessed her involvement to her employer the Monday after the photo went viral.

Briskman said she was then promptly fired on Tuesday from the government contracting firm and escorted out of the building for violating the ""code of conduct policy.""

“They said, ‘We’re separating from you,‘” Briskman told the Huffington Post. “Basically, you cannot have ‘lewd’ or ‘obscene’ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off ‘obscene.’”

Briskman, who claimed she was fired because her employer was worried about losing government contracts, said she has contacted the American Civil Liberties Union. She insisted she would flip off the president again if given the chance.

But there’s also no question that a small subset of Muslims in this country don’t fit the above description, because they support the aims of radical Islamic terrorists.
One thing’s for sure: you won’t find any radical Muslim terrorists who are not Muslims.
Perhaps the Army will next follow suit and appoint civilian monitors to determine where and when it can fight radical Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Perhaps the tool most needed in fighting radical Islamic terrorism today is a strong backbone.","When you’re getting dressed in the morning, you look for a shirt in your closet – not your refrigerator. When you want to go out to dinner, you look for a restaurant – not a dentist’s office. And when you’re a cop looking for radical Islamic terrorists … well, let’s just say you don’t look in a convent, a monastery or a rabbinical seminary.

Is this politically correct? Absolutely not. Is it simple common sense? Of course it is.

There’s no question that the vast majority of Muslims in America are peaceful, law-abiding and hardworking men and women. They serve in our armed forces and police departments, teach in our schools, treat us in hospitals, and work in countless other jobs that benefit our nation. We welcome and appreciate them.

But there’s also no question that a small subset of Muslims in this country don’t fit the above description, because they support the aims of radical Islamic terrorists. And an even smaller, very tiny subset actually engages in terrorism. Finding these people after they commit terrorist acts is challenging. Finding them before they commit terrorist acts and stopping them is incredibly difficult.

A basic principle of police work is that you use logic and common sense when searching for criminals of any kind. You can’t search for everyone everywhere, so you narrow the field of possible suspects. What does the suspected criminal look like – race, sex, height, weight, hair color and style, and so on? Where do you think the suspect might be? These and related questions hold true whether the search is for a robber, a rapist, a drug dealer or a terrorist.

Where might a radical Islamic terrorist be? Well … wild guess … mosques, other areas where Muslims get together, and Muslim neighborhoods. One thing’s for sure: you won’t find any radical Muslim terrorists who are not Muslims.

It does not take a brilliant detective like Dick Tracy or Sherlock Holmes to figure this out. Even the imbecilic film detective Inspector Clouseau could do it.

Yet in New York City last week, where a radical Islamic terrorist drove his truck into innocent people on a bike path on Halloween – killing eight and injuring a dozen – police and other law enforcement officials are being handcuffed. They are being told to ignore their common sense and training, and not focus on Muslims when looking for Muslim terrorists.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said that the Halloween terrorist – indentified by police as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, a Muslim who emigrated from Uzbekistan – was radicalized here in the United States, not in his home country, which has a history of violent Islamic extremists.

If the governor is correct, than where in the U.S. did the radicalization take place? And before we jump to the convenient presumption that Saipov was “self-radicalized” or a “lone wolf,” we should realize by now that terrorists are not hatched overnight after sitting in their basements watching videos.

No one lives in a vacuum. Radicalization is a process that includes both internal and external catalysts and occurs in many environments. That principle was laid out in a report created by the New York City Police Department’s Intelligence Division in 2006 titled “Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat: The NYPD Report,” authored by Mitchell D. Silber and Arvin Bhatt.

The report was a seminal tutorial on how and where the radicalization of “unremarkable” individuals occurred. It was a vital component of the NYPD’s counterterrorism program until 2016.

But last year Mayor Bill de Blasio caved in to demands from the American Civil Liberties Union and several Muslim activist organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, and ordered the counterterrorism report removed from both the NYPD’s website and its training manuals.

And if that was not enough, the mayor also ordered the police to discontinue standard police practices of surveillance and undercover operations of the group most susceptible to radical Islamic terrorists – the Muslim community of the greater New York and New Jersey metropolitan area.

De Blasio’s absurd action came in response to a 2012 lawsuit filed in Newark, New Jersey by Muslim advocates. They claimed that the NYPD was profiling them strictly on the basis of their religion and that they had suffered irreparable damages as a result of police actions.

But U.S. District Judge William J. Martini ruled in 2014 that the NYPD’s investigative practices did not violate the Constitution, nor were any damages suffered by the Muslim community. The plaintiffs appealed the decision and the case was to be reheard. Unfortunately, de Blasio then inexplicably surrendered to the demands of those suing the police department and withdrew from defending the NYPD against the lawsuit.

One of the mosques in New Jersey that claimed to have been unjustly surveilled was the Omar Mosque in Patterson. This is the same mosque attended by Sayfullo Saipov, the now-accused self-proclaimed ISIS follower who struck on Halloween.

Yet NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller stated publicly that the Saipov case has nothing to do with Islam or which mosque someone attended. How quickly he forgets.

Perhaps Miller needs to go back and reread the 2002 book he wrote titled “The Cell: Inside the 9/11 Plot and Why the FBI and CIA Failed to Stop It.” Back then, he clearly acknowledged the obvious fact that that radical Islamic terrorists have connections with Muslim communities.

And as if to add insult to injury, New York City has agreed to an amendment to a court decision that oversees police intelligence investigations of political and religious organizations. De Blasio will now appoint a civilian monitor who will have oversight over who the police department can or cannot investigate.

Perhaps the Army will next follow suit and appoint civilian monitors to determine where and when it can fight radical Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq. That would make as much sense as the de Blasio policy.

Here’s the bottom line: We need to spend less time worrying about being politically correct and more time worrying about how to protect the American people from bloodthirsty radical Islamic terrorists who want to kill and injure as many of us as possible.

At some point, we have to let the police be the police and investigate terrorists and other criminals – regardless of religion, ethnicity or race – based on tried and true procedures.

Good police investigative work in years past resulted in many arrests against criminal organizations like the Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, even though Italians and Colombians were disproportionately represented in these groups. It would have been as silly to search for Mafia kingpins in mosques as it would be to try hunting down ISIS terrorists at Knights of Columbus meetings.

Good police work can be effective against Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda, which often infiltrate the Muslim communities in the United States, only if police are allowed to do their jobs.

Hopefully, the NYPD under the current leadership of Commissioner James O’Neil, a career cop, will be allowed to go where the evidence leads, utilizing every tool at its disposal and not bow to political correctness when investigating potential terrorists and their hideouts. Perhaps the tool most needed in fighting radical Islamic terrorism today is a strong backbone.",Ditch political correctness and wise up.

Before knowing almost anything about Sunday’s mass public shooting, gun control advocates are once again calling for more gun control. The attack at the First Baptist Church in tiny Sutherland Springs, Texas, claimed 26 lives and left people with an understandable desire to “do something.” One thing is certain: the proposals put forward by gun control advocates wouldn’t have stopped this attack.

What they ignored was what stopped the killer was a good guy with a gun. As one witness said, without the good guy with a gun it “would have been much worse.” If more people were carrying guns, the attack might have been stopped even faster and more lives would have been saved.

Democratic Senators such as Dick Durbin (Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), and Kamala Harris (Calif.) all immediately made statements that were various versions of, “Congress must act.”

The media spent all day after the attack rhetorically asking whether now was the time for more gun control.

The shooter, identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, was found dead in his vehicle and believed to have suffered a ""self-inflicted"" gun shot wound.

Famous faces have since been utilizing their social media accounts to share messages online. While most offer their condolences, others have used the incident to call for more gun control in the United States.

In the wake of the shooting, the National Rifle Association also has been slammed by ""Veep"" actor Timothy Simons and ""Nurse Jackie"" actor Lenny Jacobson.

"".@nra you are a terrorist organization. you aid, abet, and protect terrorists,"" Simons tweeted.

Comedian Chelsea Handler was also among the first to react to the incident, blaming Republicans by saying: “Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans.”

Britney Spears offered thoughts and prayers for the community saying, “My heart breaks over the news coming out of Texas. My prayers are with the Sutherland Springs community.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook shared those sentiments saying, “Shocked and sorrowed by the heartbreaking news from Texas. Prayers for all those touched by violence today: victims, survivors, worshippers.”

“Just nothing. No words. Numb. Again. May everyone affected in Texas rest in and find peace,” wrote singer Josh Groban.

“No words. My heart is broken for Sutherland Springs, TX and for 2017 America. Please let’s all come together,” wrote comedian Sarah Silverman.

Others focused their thoughts less on the victims and community and more on calling for gun control.

Writer and director Adam McKay wrote, “Mass carnage in Sutherland Springs. We can do better than this. The idea of zero new gun safety laws isn’t just idiotic it’s murderous.”

“Prayers for #SanAntonio and all the families who are suffering the loss of loved ones. I’ll pray also for #GunControl,” said Lady Gaga.

Debra Messing called on congress directly saying, “CONGRESS- the Horror of #SutherlandSprings is on YOU. BAN #gunstocks NOW. Las Vegas was basically Yesterday! Shameful, complicit,no excuses.”

It’s not a mere coincidence. The dynasties at the top of the two major parties for the past quarter-century are under attack from within as never before. Trump ran as a rejection especially of George W. Bush in the 2016 Republican primaries and used Jeb Bush as a foil during the debates, riding that anti-establishment wave all the way to the White House.

Hillary Clinton was able to beat back a surprisingly strong primary challenge from Sanders, the septuagenarian socialist senator from Vermont who had never even appeared on the ballot as a Democrat before. But Sanders was running against Bill Clinton’s centrist Democratic Leadership Council legacy as much as his was a protest candidacy against Hillary.

Both outcomes have been second-guessed. Hillary’s defeat at the hands of Trump has some Democrats quietly questioning whether Sanders was right all along, even as they cheer her not-so-cathartic book tour. Republicans (and more than a few liberals) have begun to miss the virtues of both Presidents Bush after prolonged exposure to Trump’s vices.

Nevertheless, the underlying political conditions in both parties appear to be moving against the Bushes and Clintons. Look no further than Virginia, where no less of a Bush Republican than Ed Gillespie has taken a page out of Trump’s playbook to run a hard-nosed campaign in which culture war issues have been more prominent than his preferred technocratic policy solutions (though one could argue his campaign ads are also reminiscent of the work the late Lee Atwater did for George H.W. Bush).",The Clinton and Bush Dynasties Face Challenges from Inside Their Own Parties,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/clinton-and-bush-dynasties-face-challenges-inside-their-own-parties

Young, meanwhile, said she’s no longer blaming herself for the “unwanted sexual attention” that came her way.
“It’s not my fault if a man wants to turn a professional environment into a playground of flirting, grabbing and sexual talk,” Young wrote.","A journalist at The Root says the Rev. Jesse Jackson sexually harassed her after a speech at a previous employer, claiming he grabbed her thigh before saying, “I like all of that right there!”

Danielle Young, a writer-producer at The Root, detailed her experience with Jackson in a 2,000-word post published on Monday, alleging that Jackson touched her inappropriately while taking a photo with him after a keynote speech by the “living legend” at a “very popular” media company.

“I walked toward Jackson, smiling, and he smiled back at me,” Young wrote. “His eyes scanned my entire body. All of a sudden, I felt naked in my sweater and jeans. As I walked within arm’s reach of him, Jackson reached out a hand and grabbed my thigh, saying, ‘I like all of that right there!’ and gave my thigh a tight squeeze.”

The unexpected touch, Young said, left her “shocked, to say the least,” and uncomfortable in a room full of colleagues. So, she started to laugh, she said.

“And I continued to giggle as he pulled me in closer, stared down at my body, smiled and told me he was only kidding,” Young continued. “The entire time, my co-worker snapped photos.”

Young’s post included seven photos of herself with Jackson, including one in which Jackson’s right arm is around her neck while his left arm embraces Young’s arm across her body. Both Young and Jackson are smiling in five of the photos. In another, Young, who said she was “visibly uncomfortable” at the time, is pointing directly at the camera, “asking [Jackson] if we can just take the picture,” according to her post.

“When I was finally able to pull myself away from the Rev. Jackson’s grip, I was deflated,” Young said. “I admired this man who marched alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a man who represented our ability to overcome, a man who is really … just a man.”

After contacting a former colleague, Young said she realized her take on the situation was not unique.

“I remember him being inappropriate with all the women,” Young said, recalling the co-worker’s take. “And I also remember you telling me that he did something more with you. And then we brushed the shit off and chalked it up to him just being a dirty old man.”

Young said she never wanted to come forward with her accusation of sexual harassment because it was “just a thigh grab,” barely even a “blip on anyone’s radar,” including her own.

“Jackson’s tight grip doesn’t even measure up to what any of the victims of Harvey Weinstein and others have had to endure; however, I was uncomfortable and had to swallow the lump in my throat as I stood right beside the civil rights leader,” Young wrote. “… My silence gave Jackson permission to continue grabbing at the next pair of thick thighs he liked. I’m hoping that my voice does the opposite.”

Young also accused director John Singleton of being inappropriate toward her while at the American Black Film Festival in June. After interviewing Singleton and the cast of his new show, Young said the director best known for “Boyz n the Hood” grabbed her wrist and pulled her toward him while saying, “Bring that juiciness over here.”

Singleton then leaned forward and kissed Young on the cheek, she said.

“I said, ‘Oh, oh, OK,’ and stood up, embarrassed because everyone was definitely still in the room,” Young said. “Mostly, no one reacted, aside from a few seconds of laughter. A few people asked Singleton for a photo, and I didn’t. He noticed.”

Young then took a selfie with Singleton and posted it onto Instagram, complete with a caption of what Young said the “legend” uttered to her: “Oooh, I’m gonna grab on tight to you.”

Another woman working at the festival then confirmed Young’s suspicion regarding the unwanted sexual attention.

“She said, ‘Yeah, girl, I heard he likes big girls,’” Young said. “ … The woman’s admission was so pedestrian, I was convinced she was simply reacting the same way many women do to unwanted sexual attention — she ignored it. I tried to ignore it, but I felt weird.”

In a statement to The Root, Jackson said: “Although Rev. Jackson does not recall the meeting three years ago, he profoundly and sincerely regrets any pain Ms. Young may have experienced.”

Singleton did not return requests for comment by The Root and The Post.

Young, meanwhile, said she’s no longer blaming herself for the “unwanted sexual attention” that came her way.

The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.

The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI’s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – making Fusion’s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.

The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. At that time, Fox News has learned that bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.

But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom, a confidential source told Fox News. Court records reviewed by Fox News, email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair’s presence together. The source told Fox News they also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.

""What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington."" - Marc Thiessen, former Bush Administration official

Simpson’s presence with Veselnitskaya during this critical week in June -- together with revelations about Fusion’s simultaneous financial ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign and Russian interests -- raise new questions about the company’s role in the 2016 election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Trump Tower meeting as part of his probe of Russian interference in last year’s election.

Simpson and Fusion GPS were hired by BakerHostetler, which represented Russian firm Prevezon through Veselnitskaya.

Veselnitskaya has said she sought the Trump Tower meeting in order to lobby the candidate’s team against Russian sanctions, but the initial approach included an offer of compromising information on candidate Clinton.

Lawyers representing Fusion and Veselnitskaya did not respond to requests for comment lodged on Friday.

Senate Judiciary Committee investigators interviewed Simpson for more than 10 hours on Aug. 22. A spokesman for the committee had no comment on whether Simpson confirmed his contact with Veselnitskaya during the closed-door session.

The DNC and Clinton campaign hired Fusion in April 2016 through lawyer Marc Elias, who was general counsel for the Clinton campaign. Fusion, in turn, paid Steele $168,000 for the dossier, memos from which were shared with the FBI in the summer of 2016.

Fusion officials said last week Steele's money came from $1.02 million it received in fees and expenses from Elias' law firm Perkins Coie. Prior to contracting with the DNC, Fusion had been conducting research into Trump and other Republican candidates on behalf of the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon.

NBC News first reported that Veselnitskaya and Simpson were both at a hearing centered around another Fusion client, Russian oligarch Denis Katsyv. His company, Prevezon Holdings, was sanctioned against doing business in the U.S. for its alleged role in laundering more than $230 million. Fox News obtained audio records from that hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

The wrongdoing had been uncovered by Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested for probing Prevezon and other companies with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In December 2012, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act was passed into U.S. law, freezing Russian assets and banning visas for sanctioned individuals. Fusion’s Simpson is believed to have been working with Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet counter-intelligence officer turned Russian-American lobbyist, to overturn the sanctions.

Akhmetshin also attended the June 9 Trump Tower meeting, along with about a half-dozen others including Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, publicist Rob Goldstone, Natalia's Russian translator Anatoli Samochornov and Ike Kaveladze from a Russian-American real estate agency.

Mueller’s interest in Fusion is unclear, but the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of several related congressional probes, recently struck a deal to gain access to Fusion’s bank records after initially issuing a subpoena. The records show that the DNC funded Fusion’s dossier effort.

Over the weekend, Fusion GPS sought a new restraining order after the House panel requested additional records that could reveal if Fusion was paying media companies or reporters for planting stories.

""What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington,"" Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former Bush administration official, said. ""It's going into Hlilary Clinton. It's going to Fusion GPS. It's going into a lobbying campaign up on Capitol Hill against Magnitsky.""

Meanwhile, a request from Veselnitskaya and Katsyv for a new ""temporary immigration parole"" to return to the U.S. for a Nov. 9 Prevezon hearing in New York was denied, according to court documents reviewed by Fox News.

A Senate Judiciary Committee spokesman told Fox News they are ""encouraged"" that Veselnitskaya has ""signaled a willingness to cooperate"" with the committee.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.","In the world of conservative thought, few issues are as popular as tax reform. It's an accepted truth, by nearly anyone on the right, that the tax code is too complicated for an average citizen to understand and too laden with loopholes to be fair.

Beyond the structure of the code itself it's a fairly standard conservative view that taxes themselves are unjust, that government should not be confiscating a large chunk of our hard-earned pay and they certainly shouldn't then be helping themselves to additional taxes after that first take.

In a perfect conservative world there would either be no taxes at all or a tax which would be simple to understand, a flat tax or the Fair Tax. But we don't live in that perfect conservative world and so we recognize that tax policy, while still being burdensome, complicated and unfair, is used to achieve various societal objectives.

The marriage tax benefit, for example, is there to encourage people to get married. The electric vehicle credit exists to encourage people to reduce their oil consumption. The American Opportunity Tax Credit encourages people to go to post-secondary school such as colleges or trade schools. And so on.

What then can be seen as the point of the tax plan, called ""The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act” announced by the Republicans in the House of Representatives last Thursday? There are no obvious goals whatsoever in the convoluted plan.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.

The plan does absolutely nothing to simplify the process. No matter how many times Republican leadership promises that we’ll be able to do our taxes on a postcard, that’s not what the reality will be for nearly anyone. Credits and deductions will still exist though some have been targeted by this plan seemingly at random.

One such nonsensical target is the adoption tax credit. Where is the ideological sense in getting rid of a credit to ease the financial burden of adoption? Conservatives always suggest adoption as an alternative to abortion. But adoption is incredibly costly and the credit has been a boon to families looking to adopt, so why cut it?

“Who loses?” asked Laura Saunders in the Wall Street Journal. “Highly paid employees in high-tax states; future buyers of large homes or second homes; high-earning home sellers; people who take medical deductions; and future alimony payers, among others.”

Why get rid of the write-off for medical expenses? It’s practically an admission that single-payer is coming and Republicans don't plan to stop it. Why else not work to defray the costs of people paying for medical care out of pocket? How is that conservative?

Professionals will be hardest hit by the plan. People making $200,000-500,000 will see their taxes go up by 2023 according to a report released by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. Since when do Republicans want to disincentivize success? This isn’t targeting the super-rich, this is targeting the newly rich, families just achieving their American dream.

The mortgage interest rate deduction will drop from $1,000,000 to $500,000--an amount seemingly aimed specifically at people in blue states and the upper middle class.

The plan also doesn’t do anything for small businesses. It contains a provision to limit the tax burden to 25 percent for a small business. But as Josh Barro at Business Insider points out “More than 80 percent of tax filers with small-business income are already taxed at rates of 25 percent or less, so only the wealthiest business owners, who currently face high tax brackets, would get a tax cut.” The National Federation of Independent Business, generally a conservative group, said in a statement that they could not support the bill in its current form.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills. The free-market organization Club for Growth put out a statement noting that the bill “effectively punishes success and caves to the Democrats’ class warfare rhetoric.”

That leads to the question of why it’s such an over-compromised bill in the first place.

Conservatives claim to want a real simplification of the tax code. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has spent years promising this. If now, with a Republican House, Senate and presidency, isn’t the time to make bold moves on tax policy then when would be the time? This whole plan is an admission that Republican leadership are too afraid to ever be bold and that there will never be a true conservative movement to simplify or reduce taxes, no matter how many Republicans are elected to office.

What do conservatives believe or represent in 2017? If conservatives in Congress can't be counted on to even attempt to alter the tax code, and they can't be counted on to promote conservative values through the tax policies they design, what's the point of conservatism at all?",I'm a conservative and I hate the Republican tax plan,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/im-conservative-and-hate-republican-tax-plan.html

Eschewing the usual trend of unhealthy snacks, a certain vending machine company has introduced a range of freshly-made salads and fruit cups.

The salads, which come in jars, include flavors like cauliflower fried rice, veggies with hummus and huevos rancheros.

Canned Bread, Japan

The sweet bread, which has been cooked in the can, comes in several different flavors such as strawberry, blueberry, chocolate and green tea and will often feature popular Japanese cartoon or anime figures on the packaging.

French Fries, Australia

Dispensing chipped potatoes in paper cups, these “Hot Chip” machines can be found in gas stations, food courts and hotel lobbies across Australia.

The fries are apparently cooked fresh in around two minutes, after being deep-fried in a “healthier” bran oil. But let’s be honest, if you’re ordering fries from a vending machine, health is probably the last thing on your mind.

Sausages and Smoked Meats, Germany

Picture the scene: You’re driving home from work and suddenly get hit with a craving for some sliced ham. Never fear, for in Germany, you can simply pull over, insert a few coins into a vending machine and drive home with some ham and sausages within minutes.

We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are duking it out Tuesday in the Old Dominion commonwealth's gubernatorial race. Just one of two states electing governors this year, Virginia is a swing state contest viewed as a possible referendum on Trump's first year in office, and the president fired off a series of tweets in support of Gillespie early Tuesday morning.

Northam leads Gillespie by 5 percentage points in Fox News' latest polling average. Trump lost to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points in Virginia during the 2016 presidential election.

Here’s a look at the candidates.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This isn’t Ed Gillespie’s first rodeo when it comes to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touts his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is “most proud” of “his career fighting for children – as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.”

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for re-election, Northam, 58, would be expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He is for greater gun control and abortion rights. He has also promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration,” according to his campaign website.

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. The pair has two children, a son who is a neurosurgery resident and a daughter who is working as a web developer.

Endorsements and ads

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate hasn’t totally embraced the president or his politics on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Trump also accused Northam of “fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.”

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He has also called the president a “narcissistic maniac” multiple times during the primary.

""Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia. He’s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment and has been horrible on Virginia economy,"" Trump tweeted on the morning of the election.

Advertisements from both sides have been criticized as the race heads to a close.

Northam’s campaign came under fire for a Democratic mailer that shows Gillespie and Trump along with a photo of the angry white nationalists carrying torches who descended on Charlottesville, Va., in August. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”

Northam has stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing Trump “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”

“Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Another highly criticized ad – this one from the nonprofit Latino Victory Fund – shows scared minority children being chased by a truck with a “Gillespie for governor” sticker, a Gadsden flag vanity license plate and Confederate flag.

“Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?” a narrator asks in the one-minute spot.

Chris Leavitt, Gillespie’s campaign manager, slammed the advertisement as “an all-out attack on the people of Virginia” and blamed “Northam and his allies” for what he called a “desperate smear campaign.”

Northam’s supporters “have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile televison ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery,” Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News.

Northam's campaign has defended the ad. Campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement that, ""It's not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.""

The ad was deleted after the New York City terrorist attack in October.

Gillespie, too, has been criticized for ads in support of his campaign. He has released several ads that attempt to tie Northam to the MS-13 gang.

One ad in particular shows a sinister hooded figure holding a baseball bat as the word’s “Kill, Rape, Control” – MS-13’s motto – flash on the screen. The ad accuses Northam of being “weak” on combating the gang.

The Northam campaign has called Gillespie’s ads “beyond the pale.”

Bush hosted a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia earlier this month. And Vice President Mike Pence joined him at a weekend rally.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York earlier this month. And former Vice President Joe Biden backed Northam during a roundtable event.

Former President Barack Obama also campaigned with Northam earlier in October, and Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., will show his support at an event later this week.

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

It's not just any tatty old hat stuffed in the back of the wardrobe, though, but a hi-tech new product.

Ford has revealed its Alert Cap that monitors the driver and gives them a jolt if they're drifting off.

It's fitted with sensors and a gyroscope to track head movement and recognise when a motorist is looking at the road and if they're tired.

If the hat thinks the driver is nodding off, it will warn them by lighting up, vibrating and letting off a sound.

And while it's only at prototype stage now, the hat will be put into production.

Ford is targeting truckers with the Alert Cap developed to mark 60 years of building commercial vehicles in Brazil.

Trucking in Brazil is considered an extremely dangerous job.

Research has found 11 per cent of Brazilian lorry drivers - who drive more than 60,000 miles per year on average - have been in an accident over the past two years.

Lyle Watters, president of Ford America, South, said: ""Ford is the first automaker to think of a 'wearable' technology to use while the driver is behind the wheel and can contribute to accident prevention.

""In this way, we reinforce our commitment to bring technology onboard not only in vehicles, but also in accessories that make life easier for the driver, and focus on safety as a priority in our technology investment.""

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been fighting Saudi-backed forces there for several years, claimed responsibility for firing the ballistic missile on Saturday. The missile traveled more than 500 miles before Saudi Arabia intercepted it.

The official Saudi Press Agency charged that debris from the missile proved that it was made in Iran and smuggled into Yemen. American officials have previously charged that Iran has armed the Houthi rebels.

The attempted missile strike was ""a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime and could rise to be considered as an act of war,"" the Saudi Press Agency said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia “reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner, in accordance with international law and based on the right of self-defense,"" the statement continued.

Speaking to CNN, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir unambiguously charged that Iran had effectively declared war.

""We see this as an act of war,"" he said. ""Iran cannot lob missiles at Saudi cities and towns and expect us not to take steps.""

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called Saudi Arabia's claims ""false, irresponsible, destructive and provocative,"" according to the Iranian news agency Tasnim.

The unprecedented arrests were seen as a sign that 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who came to power in June, was seeking to aggressively consolidate power.","Saudi Arabia calls missile launch 'act of war' by Iran, vows retaliation",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/07/saudi-arabia-calls-missile-launch-act-war-by-iran-vows-retaliation.html

While the 49-year-old TV host and producer was all too familiar with Joan’s mountainous collection, which reportedly included filing cabinets with 69,000 quips to ensure she never repeated a line, Melissa wasn’t expecting to share them with the world.

With enough convincing, Melissa, along with Joan’s friend and publicist Scott Currie, chose to share those rarely-seen archives in a coffee table book, titled “Joan Rivers: Confidential,” which was released earlier this year. It’s a loving homage to the raspy voiced, razor-sharp comedian who died in 2014 at the age of 81.

“We were having to go through everything in her apartment and start to close the whole thing after I sold it,” Melissa recalled to Fox News. “There was so much stuff in storage. My parents were these incredible record keepers. They also had files and scrapbooks.

A post shared by Melissa Rivers (@melissariversofficial) on Aug 8, 2017 at 5:24pm PDT

""Scott kept saying to me, ‘There’s something in here… There’s a book here.’ And I was like, ‘Oh God, no there’s not.’ And he kept on me, convincing me. And I said, ‘Fine. If you can put something together and prove to me that there’s a book here then I’ll think about it. And he put something together… [I] sent it to my agent and it sold in a day.”

When asked if going through her mother’s belongings helped her cope with the loss, Melissa joked, “I’m not sure the book helped me cope, but it certainly helped get my storage bills under control.”

While Melissa wasn’t surprised by the discovery, as it was far from a family secret, fans will be shocked to learn that Joan, who was recognized as one of America’s most successful female stand-up comics, originally dreamed of a different role for herself.

“Well, she wanted to be a very serious actress,” said Melissa. “My grandfather was very funny. And my mother was always funny. And her sister was funny. Apparently, her mother was just very formal and not terribly funny. But they definitely had my grandfather, her father’s sense of humor. And they would always just be laughing. That was such an innate, comfortable space for her that eventually, that’s just where she landed. But the big thing was that she was going to be a serious, dramatic actress.”

However, the change in career plans worked for the brassy Brooklyn native. Her no-nonsense approach to comedy left millions of viewers in stitches. And no one in Hollywood was off-limits, not even the queen of glamour. Joan’s files revealed there were about 850 jokes dedicated to Elizabeth Taylor alone.

“Elizabeth Taylor became a favorite because, you gotta remember, women of my mother’s generation, they all wanted to be her,” said Melissa. “Every girl wanted to be ‘National Velvet.’ Every little girl wanted to grow up and be beautiful and glamorous — and the diamonds and the men fighting over her. This was their fantasy... And I think that’s where that all began.”

A post shared by Elizabeth Taylor (@elizabethtaylor) on Feb 17, 2017 at 1:15pm PST

While many of Joan’s one-liners focused on Taylor’s weight gain over the years, the Oscar-winner didn’t seemed bothered by the seemingly vicious commentary. When mutual friend Roddy McDowall approached Taylor about Joan’s comedy, she gave a shocking answer.

“…The message that came back to my mom was ‘It doesn’t hurt me where I live,’” said Melissa. “Which is a pretty incredible answer. And as we saw the things that she did later in life, you get that. She always knew who she was, regardless of everything that was swirling around her.""

And while some of Joan’s infamous jokes could have easily offended her targets, Melissa insisted she was never out to hurt anyone. And if Joan was aware that any of her subjects or their families were genuinely upset by her puns, she would immediately remove them from her act.

“You look at the bulk of the material, and I would say a good 98 percent is self-deprecating with her as the butt of the joke,” said Melissa. “Everyone used to ask if it would upset my dad (TV producer Edgar Rosenberg) that she made so many jokes about my dad. And my mom would always say, ‘You aren’t listening carefully. The jokes aren’t about Edgar. The jokes are about me!’… It was making fun of herself… She was never intent on hurting anyone.”

But Joan easily gained both fame and famous fans, including former President Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles. Melissa explained humor was the reason behind their lasting friendships.

“President Reagan was funny,” said Melissa. “You forget, he was an actor and a great storyteller… And my mother’s dear friend was Nancy Reagan. So that was a friendship that lasted through the years.

""The same with Prince Charles… He’s a big fan of comedy. And has a huge, hilarious sense of humor… A real friendship developed between my mother and Prince Charles and Camilla. … The bond was truly made through a mutual sense of humor… In private, the whole family has great, great humor.”

Joan earned a lasting career by mercilessly insulting nearly anyone, living or dead and happily criticizing the couture worn by celebrities on the red carpet. But when cameras stopped rolling, she made sure to keep every reminder that her comedy made someone laugh — especially when that praise came from the type of star she once dreamed of becoming.

“She never lost the feeling of being a fan,” said Melissa. “She would always save all her correspondences. My mother was just as excited to receive a letter from a Meryl Streep as you or I would be.

One year after Donald Trump won the White House, we all seem trapped in an endless echo chamber of the 2016 campaign.

Trump keeps attacking Hillary Clinton. Hillary, on her endless book tour, keeps attacking Trump. Donna Brazile is attacking Hillary, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Robby Mook and Jennifer Palmieri, and leading Democrats are attacking Brazile for prolonging the agony of their defeat.

“For those who are telling me to shut up…go to hell,” the former interim DNC chair told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos.

Why are the media lapping this all up? Why is there still so much public interest in the last election? Why does it feel like the country hasn’t moved on?

At a similar point in their presidencies, Barack Obama wasn’t talking about John McCain. George W. Bush wasn’t talking about Al Gore. Bill Clinton wasn’t talking about George H.W. Bush. And Bush 41 wasn’t talking about Michael Dukakis. Sure, presidents always blame their predecessors for leaving them a mess, but they don’t relitigate the election.

What happened on Nov. 8, 2016 was an earthquake in which the favored Clinton dynasty lost and a bombastic billionaire with no political experience won. But it also gets dragged back into the headlines because of Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

Now Trump continues to use Clinton as a foil, but has drawn plenty of flak for repeatedly urging the Justice Department to investigate “Crooked Hillary” for past controversies. And she remains a prime target for conservative media.

Clinton uses her book interviews to keep bashing the president, which keeps her in the news and probably boosts book sales.","2016 Redux: Why Trump, Clinton and Brazile Keep Refighting the Last War",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/2016-redux-why-trump-clinton-and-brazile-keep-refighting-last-war

The war for supremacy continued as unintended consequences took shape in Season 8, Episode 3, “Monsters.”

The episode opens right where last week’s left off. King Ezekiel is giving a rousing speech to the members of The Kingdom explaining that, despite the fact that the Saviors are sending a team to their position and are aware of their impending attack, they’re not going to lose a single person in the fray. Say what one will about his propensity for speaking like a Shakespearean actor, the dialect really gets one amped up for a fight. Through some trickery, they dispatch the team that was coming to kill them with ease and move forward.

Meanwhile, we find Rick at the end of Morales’ gun barrel. Fans will remember the Season 1 character, who didn’t tag along with Rick and company to the CDC, was revealed last week to be a Savior. Rick tries to get him to understand what’s going on, but from Morales’ perspective, Rick is a straight up monster who just killed a father. He explains that Negan killed Glenn, the man who, presumably, helped save Morales’ life in the beginning of the apocalypse. Morales counters by explaining that he lost his family too, and was willing to die. That’s when the Saviors found him and gave him a purpose.

That purpose appears to be pretty high up in the ranks, as he not only orders reinforcements, but orders the Saviors that are fighting Aaron and the Alexandrians outside to retreat and come take care of Rick and anyone else inside. Also inside is Daryl, who stumbles upon Rick and Morales and takes the latter out without giving it a second thought. Unfortunately, it’s way too late and the men are inside.

Meanwhile, Jesus and Morgan are dealing with the fallout of taking a whole lot of unexpected prisoners. They’re walking them, caravan-style, back to the Hilltop where they expect Maggie to figure out what to do with them. Morgan, however, is being taunted by Jared, the savior who killed his young friend. Just when he’s about to snap and make the call to execute him on his own, walkers descend upon them. In the confusion, Jared leads a group away. Fortunately, they don’t get far as they’re all tied together. Morgan arrives and executes one. He’s about to pull the trigger on Jared when Jesus stops him.

They argue, with Morgan doing a hairpin morality turn and demanding that they end the Saviors and treat the war as a purge. Jesus insists that after war will be peace, and tells Morgan he’ll have to learn to live with these people when it’s all over.

That doesn’t sit well with Morgan, who is in full berserker mode at this point. The two martial arts experts find themselves in a fist fight in front of an audience of prisoners. Luckily, Morgan’s sharpened staff isn't as pointy as it used to be. In an impressive demonstration of combat and discipline, Jesus bests his opponent. When it’s over, Morgan snaps back to reality, apparently having little memory of what just happened.

“I’m not right,” he acknowledges. “But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

He says that he can’t be a part of Jesus’ prisoner march, and goes off in search of Jared and the others, who seized the opportunity to scamper off into the woods. Although their bad guys, it's hard to blame them for taking off.

Back at the compound, Aaron has returned to the battle at the behest of his wounded husband, Eric. The two said bye to each other so that Aaron could be where he’s needed, leading the Alexandrians in an effort to rescue Rick and Daryl. His moment comes just in time as the duo found themselves battling with just their fists by the time their team arrived. They manage to clean things up at the compound, securing yet another victory for the good guys. Although the weapons cache they were after wasn’t there.

When things are clear, Aaron returns to the tree he left Eric to find him gone. He looks in the distance and sees a walker joining a herd. He breaks down and is pulled away by an ally.

Meanwhile, back at the Hilltop, Gregory arrives looking for safe haven. Maggie greets him at the gate with every intention of banishing him from his own community. He tries to make a case that he’s actually done the right thing, but Maggie is no one’s fool. It’s not until he actually begs for his life and reminds Maggie that she’s not a killer that she breaks and lets him in. It’s not a moment too soon as Jesus then arrives with a cadre of prisoners and a gigantic problem. Gregory and Tara protest, but Jesus suggests sticking them in two trailers with around-the-clock guards until the war is over.

He really puts Maggie in a tough place as she either has to become a bloodthirsty ogre, or jeopardize the lives of the people in The Hilltop. It’s unclear what she decides, but the episode does not end with the “Walking Dead” version of a firing squad, so it seems like she accepted the prisoners.

The episode, instead, ends with Rick rescuing the baby whose father he killed. He says he has a stop to make, presumably having to do with the polaroids and letter he was writing, when Aaron asks to take on the task of caring for the baby. He lost Eric, and he tells Rick that he really has to take care of the baby, for reasons he doesn’t understand.

Just when it looks like everything is on the rise, Daryl and Rick are shot at by a rogue survivor of the Saviors. Rick tells him that they don’t have time to fight and that a herd is coming. He gives the shooter his word that he’ll let him go if he tells them where the guns are. He says they’re at the outpost being hit by the Kingdom. Daryl makes a liar out of Rick and executes the shooter before they make haste to help Carol and the gang.

As Ezekiel is declaring victory, his people are mowed down by the guns in question. The episode ends before any real casulty count can be had, but Ezekiel seems safe as about five of his loyal subjects sacrifice themselves for him.","'The Walking Dead' Season 8, Episode 3 recap: Deaths rise as the war continues",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/05/walking-dead-season-8-episode-3-recap-deaths-rise-as-war-continues.html

According to his report, Weinstein spent more than a year using private investigators to track actresses and journalists in an effort to stop his predatory behavior from going public.

The New Yorker article alleges that Weinstein hired firms like Black Cube, which is largely made up of former officers from Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies, to look into women who could potentially go on the record about his sexual harassment and assault -- and to look into journalists working on similar stories, including Farrow himself.

The goal: to “target” and suppress anyone who might come forward to ruin Weinstein's reputation, according to the report.

A representative for Weinstein denied to the outlet that anyone was targeted or suppressed at any time. Reps for Weinstein did not respond to Fox News when reached for comment.

Two private investigators from Black Cube reportedly got information from actress Rose McGowan, who has been an outspoken critic of Weinstein and has publicly accused him of rape since exposés from The New York Times and The New Yorker were published in which many women came forward to tell their respective stories about Weinstein’s predatory nature.

In addition, Farrow's new report revealed that Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer among other magazines, offered to share material a reporter had dug up which could have disproven McGowan's rape allegations. He later reportedly told Weinstein, “I have something AMAZING,” referring to audio from an off-the-record phone call between the reporter and Elizabeth Avellan, the ex-wife of director Robert Rodriguez, who had a relationship with McGowan.

Avellan told The New Yorker she never would have approved of trying to discredit McGowan. “I don’t want to shame people.”

Howard responded to the magazine by saying his work for Weinstein was separate from his work as a journalist. “I always separated those two roles carefully and completely—and resisted Mr. Weinstein’s repeated efforts to have AMI titles publish favorable stories about him or negative articles about his accusers.” He also said AMI had a now-terminated TV production agreement with Weinstein.

American Media Inc. did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

McGowan also reportedly was approached by an operative using a false name and credentials to talk with her about women’s rights issues in the workplace. In reality, she wanted to know if McGowan had spoken with any journalists and whether the actress would go on the record about her experience with Weinstein, according to the report. Not realizing that she was speaking to an operative, the “Scream” star reportedly met with the woman, and another operative who approached her at a later date, many times.

The story revealed that countless documents and audio recordings were provided to the 65-year-old studio head with information not only on actresses he allegedly assaulted, but journalists as well. The outlet cites seven people directly involved with the effort as well as “dozens of pages” of documents it unearthed as its sources for the new allegations against Weinstein.

Psychological profiles allegedly were created including information of past relationships, sexual histories and evidence of positive encounters between Weinstein and his potential accusers that could later be used to discredit the women if they came forward, which many did.

Also named in the story is Weinstein’s lawyer, David Boies, who admitted to working with Weinstein and these agencies to stop the New York Times story from being published, despite his law firm representing the Times in a libel case at the time. In October 2016, he allegedly wired Black Cube the first hundred thousand dollars of an alleged $600,000 invoice. It’s unclear how much of that total invoice was paid, but bonuses reportedly were offered if the company could stop any article from being published.

“Although he vigorously denies using physical force, Mr. Weinstein has himself recognized that his contact with women was indefensible and incredibly hurtful,” Boies told Farrow. “In retrospect, I knew enough in 2015 that I believe I should have been on notice of a problem, and done something about it. I don’t know what, if anything, happened after 2015, but to the extent it did, I think I have some responsibility. I also think that if people had taken action earlier it would have been better for Mr. Weinstein.”

Boies also did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

After a fan told McGowan that the latest New Yorker piece should be made into a film, the actress responded: “I do not need to do a film. I am the film.”","Weinstein allegedly paid 'army' of investigators, ex-Mossad agents to keep actresses, journalists from revealing predatory behavior",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/weinstein-allegedly-paid-army-investigators-ex-mossad-agents-to-keep-actresses-journalists-from-revealing-predatory-behavior.html

The Legion has previously called on the Drug Enforcement Agency to reclassify marijuana to recognize it as ""a drug with potential medical value.”

In August during the group's national convention in Nevada, the group passed a resolution calling on the federal government to allow medical providers within the Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss medical cannabis as a treatment option in states where medical marijuana is legal.

At a news conference Thursday announcing the results of the study, Legion Executive Director Verna Jones said the group is ""not advocating for recreational use of marijuana, but we are advocating for the removal of cannabis from Schedule One of the Controlled Substances Act so that more medical investigators can do research.""

The removal of marijuana from the list of ""Schedule One"" drugs, which includes heroin and Ecstasy, would place it in a different category of drugs deemed to have no medical use.

""Many veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain – especially those of the Iraq and Afghanistan generation – have told The American Legion that they have achieved improved health care outcomes by foregoing VA-prescribed opioids in favor of medical cannabis,"" the Legion said. ""While the stories of these wartime veterans are compelling, more research must be done in order to enable lawmakers to have a fact-based debate on future drug policy.""",Veterans back legalizing medicinal marijuana in American Legion survey,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/05/veterans-back-legalizing-medicinal-marijuana-in-american-legion-survey.html

The site is the first ever gym found in Egypt dating back to the ancient Hellenistic, or Greek, period. A joint team of German and Egyptian archaeologists made the discovery at Watfa in Fayoum province, about 50 miles southwest of Cairo.

Watfa is the site of the ancient village Philoteris, founded by King Ptolemy II in the 3rd century B.C and named after his second sister Philotera, according to a Facebook post by Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry.

PYRAMID DISCOVERY: SCIENTISTS USE COSMIC RAYS TO FIND MYSTERIOUS CHAMBER INSIDE ANCIENT EDIFICE

Dr. Ayman Ashmawi, Head of the Ancient Egyptian Antiquities Sector, explains that the gymnasium has a large hall for meetings that was once adorned with statues, as well as a dining hall and a courtyard. Beside the gymnasium is a 200-meter-long racetrack. Gardens also surrounded the building in what has been described as an ideal layout for a center of Greek learning.

Ancient Greek gyms were private organizations frequented by the rich, according to Dr. Cornelia Römer, who led the mission from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). Young men of the Greek-speaking upper class in Egypt would undergo sports training at the facilities, as well as learning to read and write. The gyms were also used for discussions of philosophy.

Römer says the discovery clearly shows the impact of Greek life in Egypt, not only in Alexandria, but also in the countryside.

TOMB OF KING TUT’S WIFE DISCOVERED? EXPERTS EXCITED BY FIND IN EGYPT

The gymnasium discovery is just the latest fascinating archaeological find in Egypt. Last week, for example, scientists announced that they had discovered a mysterious chamber inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza.

In September, archaeologists announced the discovery of an ancient temple belonging to King Ramses II. In August, experts revealed that they had unearthed three tombs from an ancient “great cemetery” in Egypt’s Nile Valley. A month earlier, archaeologists said that a tomb that may have belonged to the wife of King Tutankhamun had been discovered in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings.

In June, archaeologists from Yale and the Royal Museum of Art and History in Belgium announced the discovery of the earliest-known ‘billboard-sized’ hieroglyphs in the ancient city of Elkab.

Here’s what you need to know about the scandal:

Who is Kirt Webster?

Webster, 43, is a Nashville publicist who was the president and CEO of Webster PR. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Senior Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

Webster has worked in the music industry in Nashville for over 20 years. In addition to clients like Dolly Parton, his firm has also helped artists like George Jones and Kenny Rogers with their marketing campaigns.

Who is Austin Rick?

Austin Rick, whose stage name is Austin Cody, is originally from Waldorf, Maryland, but moved to Nashville to persue his music career. Rick claims Webster began sexually harassing and assaulting him in 2008.

After a year of alleged sexual assault and harassment by Webster, Rick moved back to Maryland and stepped away from his career, according to the Tennessean.

After ending his country career, Rick attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He graduated in May with a degree in sociology.

Despite moving away, Rick has said that Webster has allegedly tried to contact him as recently as this year.

Rick created a GoFundMe page on Oct. 31 to help pay for his legal fees as he prepares to take Webster to court over the allegations.

Rick said he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

“He sexually assaulted me repeatedly, he drugged and sexually violated me, he offered me publicity opportunities and magazine columns in exchange for sexual acts. He paid me to keep my mouth shut,” Rick wrote on his GoFundMe page and on Facebook.

He is crowdfunding $15,000 for his legal fees.

Rick said he was inspired to share his story after the #MeToo social media movement went viral, which began after countless allegations against famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light.

COUNTRY MUSIC'S TOP PUBLICIST ACCUSED OF PROPOSITIONING INTERN FOR SEX

What has happened since Rick came forward?

Webster has denied Rick’s claims. Since then, many of Webster’s former employees have stepped forward with harassment allegations against him. One ex-employee, a man who requested anonymity, told Fox News “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.”

Another female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions.

Many former employees also detailed stories of unwanted physical contact. And, in addition to Rick, other men have come forward with allegations against Webster.

'HOUSE OF CARDS' CREW MEMBERS CLAIM KEVIN SPACEY ROUTINELY SEXUALLY HARASSED PEOPLE ON SET

Cody Anderson, 33, told Fox News on Wednesday that Webster propositioned him for sex while he was working as an intern for Webster PR in 2010.

Webster did not return Fox News' multiple requests for comment on the allegations.

What's happening now?

Police are not pursuing Rick’s charges against Webster because a statute of limitations prevents them from doing so, the Tennessean reported.

However, in addition to Parton, Rock, and Cyrus, many of Webster’s clients have also left the company. Those artists include: Justin Moore, Naomi Judd, Charlie Daniels and more.

Parton tweeted Friday that she “hopes the accusations are not true.”",Kirt Webster accused of sexual harassment: What to know about the claims,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/kirt-webster-accused-sexual-harassment-what-to-know-about-claims.html

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.
On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.
President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.
Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history.
Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""
Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

The new homeowners, who wished to remain nameless, are now suing the Lennar construction company for fraud and breach of warranty. They’re also seeking punitive and compensatory damages, as well as any court costs they incur, per the Post.

In addition to bottles of urine, court documents say the couple found “containers containing remnants of partially eaten food, construction debris and other garbage” within the walls of their new residence at the luxury 1200 Avenue at Port Imperial building, including partially eaten Chinese food orders and cupcake wrappers. The insulation in the master bedroom was also found to be soaked in urine.

“To my knowledge that’s all very bad for your health,” said Derrick S. “There were a lot of things I saw that [weren’t] up to code.”

According to the lawsuit, Lennar was “embarrassed” by the couple’s findings, though they had not planned to open up all of the unit’s ceilings and walls for inspection. (Lennar is only opening up the lower parts of certain walls, the Post reports.) The couple also tried to sell the home back to Lennar, but their offer was rejected.

“Lennar seems to think it can get away with business as usual — by advertising luxury — while selling garbage — in Hudson County,” said the couple’s lawyer, Phil Chronakis. “I’m going to have a Hudson County jury look at what Lennar did — those jurors will be outraged as should all of us.”

Service dogs are not pets.
Service dogs for those with post-traumatic stress disorder are often on point, keeping potential triggers that would raise stress or anxiety levels for their veterans at bay.
Service dogs are not pets.
So far, we’ve just addressed how people react to service dogs.","The relationship between a service dog and a veteran is akin to a team walking a tightrope. To succeed, they must focus on each other, intently. Distract one, and both can stumble. When they are in sync, the intricate teamwork going on can appear effortless to the outside world. And this partly explains why some people, often quite innocently, insist on being a distraction. Hence the ubiquitous question:

Can I pet your dog?

Uh, no, not now. Not ever. Keep your paws off, please.

Would you want someone to ask if they could rub your heart surgeon’s head while she was operating on you? Would you think it appropriate if someone offered to rub your lawyer’s belly while he was trying to convince a jury of your innocence?

Probably not, right? You'd think these were grossly inappropriate questions and certainly needless distractions in the midst of critical, sometimes life and death, situations.

And that’s exactly how you should think about service dogs when they are about their work. Note the key word: work.

But that’s the thing. Service dogs are not pets. When their vest is on, they have an extremely important job to do.

In public, vest on, these dogs are engaged in life-saving tasks for their veterans. Guide dogs prevent blind or vision-impaired veterans from wandering into the street when a light is red. For veterans with prosthetic limbs, their dogs open doors, keep watch for things easily tripped over, or act as a brace when vets are walking or standing up. Service dogs for those with post-traumatic stress disorder are often on point, keeping potential triggers that would raise stress or anxiety levels for their veterans at bay. For veterans prone to seizures, their dogs will alert them if they sense an episode coming on.

We get it. These dogs are irresistibly cute. And clearly just the sight of one in a store or restaurant can turn normally reserved adults into children. Disabled veterans have seen grown men crawl under tables, barking to get a dog’s attention. And while they’re down there, may as well pet the pup, right? If it were them, they’d no doubt welcome having their meal interrupted so people could show their pet some love.

But that’s the thing. Service dogs are not pets. When their vest is on — the garment often emblazoned with the words “Service dog: Do not pet” — they have an extremely important job to do. They have undergone months, sometimes years, of intense training that costs tens of thousands of dollars — an expense currently not covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They are there to watch for and react to dangerous situations and await commands from their veterans. If you call to these dogs, or insist on talking to them, then, despite all that training — they are, after all, still dogs — they are potentially paying attention to you, not the veterans they are supposed to serve and protect. In other words, you’re bouncing up and down on their tightrope.

Think about it this way: If the service dog turns its head or body to see what you want, the veteran with vision loss could wind up stumbling and falling. Prosthetic limbs can be seriously damaged in the twists and turns of a tumble. Or the dog might not catch the early signs of a seizure, or miss something that causes problems for a vet with PTSD.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) actually requires owners to maintain control of their animals. Don’t make a tough job more difficult.

So far, we’ve just addressed how people react to service dogs. But their behavior toward disabled vets can be even more bizarre — and quite rude. For example, people often say, “I know it’s a service dog and he’s working, so I won’t pet him.” This is so irritating. It’s as if they are magnanimously making the decision to pet or not pet without asking prior permission. An analogy would be: “I know you have a purse and I know I am not to steal it, so I won’t.” How generous.

Worse is when people just reach out to pet a service dog, seemingly from every direction imaginable. Then they will get angry when the surprised disabled veteran turns and says, “Please don’t pet him, he’s working.” Their disturbing response? “Well, what’s wrong with you? You don’t look disabled.” People seem to genuinely believe they have a right to know this. (Maybe so they can decide in their own mind if it’s OK to pet the animal with the vest that clearly says “Do not pet”?)

That’s just wrong. There is never a need for a stranger to know a veteran’s medical history. In fact, the ADA doesn’t even allow staff in stores or restaurants to ask people with a service animal what their disability is. They are permitted two questions: Is the service animal required because of a disability? and What work or task has it been trained to perform? If veterans don’t have to disclose their disabilities in those situations, why would they ever make themselves vulnerable by blurting it out to strangers on the street?

The disabled veteran community has a slogan, Paws Off Please (POP), designed to educate people about interacting with the service animals that are becoming more and more commonplace in public. So, lesson one: If a dog has a vest on, that means it’s working; don’t pay attention to it.

But, please, don’t ever ignore the veterans. Instead, be sure to thank them for their service.

President Trump is currently in South Korea for talks having just left a visit with a similarly concerned Japanese leadership about North Korea’s nuclear threats.

Earlier this year, Trump mandated a thorough review of America’s nuclear posture and ballistic missile defense. So back in the States, some of the brightest minds in the Department of Defense have been focused on this Review that will provide the President with recommendations and options relating to the threat of nuclear war.

WILL THE US UNLEASH REVOLUTIONARY 'LIGHTNINGSTRIKE' DRONE ON FUTURE ENEMIES?

Over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that about $400 billion dollars will be invested in modernizing and maintaining U.S. nuclear forces.

The U.S. has a vast and formidable nuclear arsenal and many methods from submarines to fighter jets to deliver those bombs. But much of the nuke program dates back to the Cold War and is feeling its age. The review could provide ideas to adapt, modernize and innovate so the United States is even more prepared to tackle today’s nuclear threats.

If there were to be a nuclear attack, then it is vital that Trump has the very best options at his disposal to deliver a just response.

Enter mini nukes?

The review has been very closely held with little hinted as to what the recommendations and options will be – but we do know that last year, the Defense Science Board’s “Seven Defense Priorities for the New Administration” report recommended that the Pentagon consider focusing on more low-yield nuclear weapons – aka “mini nukes.”

Aat a recent Mitchell Institute event, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force General Paul Selva delivered incisive remarks on the subject. He noted is important to provide the President with options and “Everything is on the table in the review, from conservative strategic approaches to radical new approaches.”

The Vice Chairman’s remarks triggered a buzz with many speculating on what the future could hold for “radical options.”

Smaller, variable, more “tactical” nukes are a strong contender for development by the military in the modernization process. Amidst the hubbub, these weapons found themselves nicknamed mini-nukes. In the simplest of terms, the idea is that the power of these nuclear weapons could be adjustable.

Think of it as a “dial a yield” bomb…this mini nuke could be dialed up for stronger destruction or dialed down for less.

The mini nukes factor

If mini nukes are recommended by the review, then Trump may soon have at his disposal the ability to target a specific neighborhood with a nuclear bomb - and leave the rest of a city undamaged by the explosion.

Each mini nuke could be tailored to the specific, necessary scale of destruction. For example, it could target and annihilate say a square mile – without the areas outside that mile being hit by the explosion.

More accurate nuclear strikes with an adjustable nuke warhead could reduce collateral damage and radioactive fallout.

Of course, radiation and other related threats would still expand well beyond the blast radius. The explosion would be far more restrained, but the damage to human life and the environment would reach beyond the blast limits.

PODCAST: FIND OUT THE TRUTH BEHIND THE DRONE HEADLINES WITH THIS INTELL OPERATIVE

So how could these new mini nukes be made?

There are two primary ways this capability could be developed. Some of the military's current nuclear weapon stockpile could be adapted or the military can also develop mini nukes from square one.

The military already has some very successful initiatives underway to make nukes smaller and more precise. For example, adjustments to the B61 bombs, enhanced with advanced tech like steerable fins, have already proven very successful.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

The U.S. President must have options

President Trump already has an array of staggeringly powerful nuclear weapons at his disposal and it will only be more enhanced and advanced with the modernization program.

Variable yield mini nukes could potentially provide more flexibility and options.

Advocates for mini nuke type capability have argued that if the U.S. is attacked by North Korea with a nuclear weapon, then Trump needs the ability to launch a calibrated, targeted nuclear attack in response.

A variable yield mini nuke could give the President the means to launch a more contained strike with less radioactive fallout.

Selecting this low-yield, tailored weapon instead of a massive high yield nuke, Trump could eliminate a specific dangerous threat without destructively impacting the entire region - including allies like South Korea and Japan.

PODCAST: MEET THE NAVY SEAL WHO BECAME HOLLYWOOD STAR IN TRANSFORMERS

Responding “in kind”

Another argument for new variable, mini nukes is that it would give the President further options to respond “in kind”. For example, it is believed that North Korea could possibly unleash a nuclear weapon at the scale of about 100-kilotons – that’s enough to potentially destroy a city. The U.S. possesses thousands of nukes in a wide range of destructive power.

If a country attacked the U.S. with a 100-kiloton nuclear weapon, then the mini nuke would give Trump the option of responding with a nuke adjusted to the same strength. This would be a response “in kind” with a similar low yield attack, rather than a high yield weapon.

Avoiding civilian casualties

This sort of adjustable mini nuke could also potentially enable the US to better discriminate by specifically targeting perpetrators and reducing civilian casualties.

High-yield nuclear weapons possess immense, destructive power that could yield unimaginable horrific destruction and countless deaths. Nukes are the most horrific of weapons.

If the most terrible scenario happens and the US needs to deploy a nuke, mini nukes may be one solution to ensuring this catastrophic weapon is precise and would allow Trump to avoid vast civilian casualties as much as possible.

To put this in context, rather than unleashing a nuclear weapon that could kill a country’s entire population in example, Trump would have the option to use a tailored mini nuke to target a dangerous military installation instead.

Mini nukes are not without detractors, though.

There is no shortage of critics with a range of concerns including the argument that it is exactly the mini nuke’s precision and the reduction of destruction that makes the option tempting. And since it is more tempting, it is more likely therefore that a nuclear weapon will be used.",North Korea: Will mini nukes become an option for Trump?,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/07/north-korea-will-mini-nukes-become-option-for-trump.html

The Huffington Post reported on the passage, in which Brazile complained about her treatment by campaign manager Robby Mook and his team.

The two supposedly were at odds over Mook’s refusal to let her hire a temporary CEO when she took over the Democratic National Committee on an interim basis.

Describing a tense conference call on the matter, Brazile reportedly wrote: “I have worked with men all my life in politics and I can sense when they get to this part about not being able to deal with a woman. This is not a racial thing. This was a gender thing.”

She also reportedly wrote that she interjected during the call to say: “You know, this does not feel like a negotiation to me. This feels like power and control. Gentlemen, let’s just put our d---- out on the table and see who’s got the bigger one, because I know mine is bigger than all of yours.”

BRAZILE ALLEGATIONS EXPOSE DEM RIFT

Brazile’s allegations against Clinton’s team – including the bombshell claim that the DNC signed an agreement giving the campaign partial control over party decisions before the primary was over – have rocked the Democratic Party, and prompted strong pushback from some of Hillary Clinton’s top aides.

One ex-Clinton aide told the Huffington Post in response to the latest ""Hacks"" excerpt that, “Given that she already had to walk back her claims about a rigged nomination and was caught buying into a right-wing conspiracy about Hillary’s health, I’m not sure how much more of this book people should take seriously.”

This was an apparent reference to Brazile saying on ABC’s “This Week” there was no evidence of nomination rigging, despite her description of the special deal between the DNC and the campaign.

An open letter signed by dozens of Clinton campaign members including Mook also said “we do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.” That letter blasted one particular passage in which Brazile said she considered trying to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden amid questions about the Democratic presidential nominee's health.

Despite Brazile's complaints about the campaign's attitude toward women, Mook had some women on his team and reportedly liked Brazile’s choice for DNC CEO.

President Trump, meanwhile, has used Brazile’s claims about the DNC-Clinton camp deal to suggest a federal investigation be launched.

“The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!” he tweeted last week.

In fact, it’s one of the most beautiful aspects of the American spirit. But with every new national tragedy, it seems that unifying spirit is a little weaker than before.

On Sunday morning, tragedy struck our great country once again. A gunman opened fire in a place of worship killing at least 26 people and wounding 20 in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Even more heartbreaking, eight of the 26 victims were members of the same family. Yet somehow, as our country mourns the loss of innocent life, there’s a new wave of indignation directed at people who dare to pray for the victims.

That’s right. As well-intentioned Americans pray for their countrymen who were just gunned down while worshipping God, gun control advocates are bashing them for their expression of faith. Here are just a few examples from my Twitter feed:

Consider this from Keith Olbermann:

Or, this profane statement from Star Trek actor Wil Wheaton:

It’s one thing to hold strong opinions about gun control. But it’s entirely different to direct anger towards people of faith after such a horrific tragedy. Just because you might not believe in prayer, doesn’t give you the right to publicly insult those who do.

In some ways, this outrage against prayer is emblematic of national trends. As America grows increasingly hostile to Christianity, inappropriate and insensitive rhetoric regarding expressions of faith has become more acceptable. It seems the same people who pride themselves on advocating religious and cultural “tolerance” are the least tolerant when it comes to American Christians.

Prayer has been a staple of the American experience since the founding of our nation. It’s why George Washington “fervently beseech[ed] the Almighty” in his farewell address. It’s why Abraham Lincoln constantly invoked the name of God in our nation’s darkest moments. It’s why every session of Congress still opens in prayer.

Prayer is a unifying force, especially in a country entrenched in political polarization. It’s a way of humbly admitting that as mere humans, we do not have all the answers. Prayer is an expression of hope that someday all of the world’s evils will come to an end.

No matter how great gun control advocates think their policies may be, you can’t legislate evil away. Certainly, it’s important that policymakers engage in productive dialogue about methods to help mitigate future violence. But the most perfect legislation (if one ever existed), still leaves our country in need of the Almighty.

As long as there is evil in this world, Americans should continue to exercise their right to pray for a brighter day. This is—no doubt—a troubling time for our nation. But it’s times like these that often bring forth the best that our nation has to offer. Slandering the faithful among us isn’t the path to a unified, peaceful America.

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are duking it out Tuesday in the Old Dominion commonwealth's gubernatorial race. Just one of two states electing governors this year, Virginia is a swing state contest viewed as a possible referendum on Trump's first year in office, and the president fired off a series of tweets in support of Gillespie early Tuesday morning.

Northam leads Gillespie by 5 percentage points in Fox News' latest polling average. Trump lost to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points in Virginia during the 2016 presidential election.

Here’s a look at the candidates.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This isn’t Ed Gillespie’s first rodeo when it comes to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touts his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is “most proud” of “his career fighting for children – as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.”

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for re-election, Northam, 58, would be expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He is for greater gun control and abortion rights. He has also promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration,” according to his campaign website.

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. The pair has two children, a son who is a neurosurgery resident and a daughter who is working as a web developer.

Endorsements and ads

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate hasn’t totally embraced the president or his politics on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Trump also accused Northam of “fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.”

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He has also called the president a “narcissistic maniac” multiple times during the primary.

""Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia. He’s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment and has been horrible on Virginia economy,"" Trump tweeted on the morning of the election.

Advertisements from both sides have been criticized as the race heads to a close.

Northam’s campaign came under fire for a Democratic mailer that shows Gillespie and Trump along with a photo of the angry white nationalists carrying torches who descended on Charlottesville, Va., in August. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”

Northam has stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing Trump “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”

“Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Another highly criticized ad – this one from the nonprofit Latino Victory Fund – shows scared minority children being chased by a truck with a “Gillespie for governor” sticker, a Gadsden flag vanity license plate and Confederate flag.

“Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?” a narrator asks in the one-minute spot.

Chris Leavitt, Gillespie’s campaign manager, slammed the advertisement as “an all-out attack on the people of Virginia” and blamed “Northam and his allies” for what he called a “desperate smear campaign.”

Northam’s supporters “have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile televison ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery,” Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News.

Northam's campaign has defended the ad. Campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement that, ""It's not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.""

The ad was deleted after the New York City terrorist attack in October.

Gillespie, too, has been criticized for ads in support of his campaign. He has released several ads that attempt to tie Northam to the MS-13 gang.

One ad in particular shows a sinister hooded figure holding a baseball bat as the word’s “Kill, Rape, Control” – MS-13’s motto – flash on the screen. The ad accuses Northam of being “weak” on combating the gang.

The Northam campaign has called Gillespie’s ads “beyond the pale.”

Bush hosted a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia earlier this month. And Vice President Mike Pence joined him at a weekend rally.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York earlier this month. And former Vice President Joe Biden backed Northam during a roundtable event.

Former President Barack Obama also campaigned with Northam earlier in October, and Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., will show his support at an event later this week.

One year after Donald Trump won the White House, we all seem trapped in an endless echo chamber of the 2016 campaign.

Trump keeps attacking Hillary Clinton. Hillary, on her endless book tour, keeps attacking Trump. Donna Brazile is attacking Hillary, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Robby Mook and Jennifer Palmieri, and leading Democrats are attacking Brazile for prolonging the agony of their defeat.

“For those who are telling me to shut up…go to hell,” the former interim DNC chair told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos.

Why are the media lapping this all up? Why is there still so much public interest in the last election? Why does it feel like the country hasn’t moved on?

At a similar point in their presidencies, Barack Obama wasn’t talking about John McCain. George W. Bush wasn’t talking about Al Gore. Bill Clinton wasn’t talking about George H.W. Bush. And Bush 41 wasn’t talking about Michael Dukakis. Sure, presidents always blame their predecessors for leaving them a mess, but they don’t relitigate the election.

What happened on Nov. 8, 2016 was an earthquake in which the favored Clinton dynasty lost and a bombastic billionaire with no political experience won. But it also gets dragged back into the headlines because of Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

Now Trump continues to use Clinton as a foil, but has drawn plenty of flak for repeatedly urging the Justice Department to investigate “Crooked Hillary” for past controversies. And she remains a prime target for conservative media.

Clinton uses her book interviews to keep bashing the president, which keeps her in the news and probably boosts book sales.","2016 Redux: Why Trump, Clinton and Brazile Keep Refighting the Last War",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/2016-redux-why-trump-clinton-and-brazile-keep-refighting-last-war#commenting

He had been asked whether he would support ""extreme vetting"" for gun purchases similar to the ""extreme vetting"" he's called for of people entering the country.

Trump says if that a neighboring good Samaritan hadn't had a gun, ""instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

Four steps to take when deciding if you should let someone who betrayed you back into your life.

FOX's Ashley Papa has more:

Betrayal by a loved one is one of the most painful experiences. If you're thinking of letting someone who betrayed you back into your life, counselor, David Essel says first you must forgive:

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

It's not just any tatty old hat stuffed in the back of the wardrobe, though, but a hi-tech new product.

Ford has revealed its Alert Cap that monitors the driver and gives them a jolt if they're drifting off.

It's fitted with sensors and a gyroscope to track head movement and recognise when a motorist is looking at the road and if they're tired.

If the hat thinks the driver is nodding off, it will warn them by lighting up, vibrating and letting off a sound.

And while it's only at prototype stage now, the hat will be put into production.

Trucking in Brazil is considered an extremely dangerous job.

Research has found 11 per cent of Brazilian lorry drivers - who drive more than 60,000 miles per year on average - have been in an accident over the past two years.

Lyle Watters, president of Ford America, South, said: ""Ford is the first automaker to think of a 'wearable' technology to use while the driver is behind the wheel and can contribute to accident prevention.

""In this way, we reinforce our commitment to bring technology onboard not only in vehicles, but also in accessories that make life easier for the driver, and focus on safety as a priority in our technology investment.""

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV. Or if you’d rather opt for a cabinet enclosure, you can conceal additional media components, like speakers or game consoles. Although these options are more expensive and time-consuming, they will completely conceal your TV from view. Do your research and consult an experienced cabinetmaker, electrician or media professional to make the job more manageable.",3 strategies for disguising your TV in plain sight,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/3-strategies-for-disguising-your-tv-in-plain-sight.html

Evidently, the monarch has a “no knees” policy when it comes to her royal family’s outfits, which the 36-year-old “Suits” star is dutifully respecting, according to Cosmopolitan.

THE ONE THING KATE MIDDLETON NEVER WEARS

Before Prince Harry entered her life, Markle was often spotted rocking mini dresses, skirts and shorts, looks she’s largely seemed to phase out of her wardrobe since making things public with the fifth in line to the throne.

Since then, she’s looked equally comfortable in floor-length gowns on the red carpet and chic button-down-and-jeans ensembles alike.

""I think as you get older you feel more confident and you don't need to put that much effort in - to be able to throw your hair up in that very French way doing things. If your outfit is on point, one thing has to be off for you to look perfect."" She told Glamour UK in a May 2017 interview.

You need a Knicks hat,’” Porzingis told the New York Daily News in 2015.
But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.","It was an end-to-end sequence that brought the crowd at New York’s Madison Square Garden to its feet.

With just under 5 minutes remaining in a Friday night win over the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks center Kristaps Porzingis raced back on defense for an emphatic block of a shot by Suns rookie Josh Jackson, then raced forward on offense to execute a powerful dunk – and even draw a foul in the process.

""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" rang the chants from the Garden crowd.

Porzingis ended the game with 37 points as New York topped Phoenix, 120-107.

That was just one point shy of the career-high 38 that Porzingis scored just four nights earlier in a win against the Denver Nuggets. And it was his sixth 30-point performance in eight games this season for the 4-4 Knicks.

In other words, Porzingis has been getting the message out across the NBA:

A young star is becoming an even bigger star.

Just months ago, the Knicks seemed to be a team in disarray. Team president and failed messiah Phil Jackson had been jettisoned after an unexpectedly rocky tenure with the club, and hometown favorite player Carmelo Anthony had been shipped off to the Oklahoma City Thunder after nearly seven seasons in New York.

With the marquee names gone, the team was now in the hands of Porzingis, the 7-foot-3, 22-year-old import from Latvia whose arrival in New York via the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft initially drew groans from fans and the humbling question, “Who?”

But these days Porzingis No. 6 jerseys are an increasingly familiar sight around the streets of Gotham, beginning to replace the fraying No. 7 jerseys with Anthony’s name. (Last season, Forbes ranked Porzingis' jersey as the seventh-best seller, while Anthony's ranked 15th.)

Porzingis is now undeniably the face of the Knicks – and it’s a role he seems to relish. He even appears to enjoy razzing the cross-town rival Brooklyn Nets and their fans.

“Sometimes I see somebody with a Brooklyn hat on, I say, ‘What is that? You need a Knicks hat,’” Porzingis told the New York Daily News in 2015.

But Porzingis’ desire to stay in New York was recently called into question when a Latvian magazine published some comments by his brother, Janis Porzingis, who works for the firm that represents the Knick.

Janis Porzingis cited his brother's dissatisfaction with the Knicks last season, when he skipped his exit interview, and noted that Kristaps would need to be happy to re-sign with the team in the future, even if leaving meant taking less money.

But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.

""I think the fans know I'm here in New York, I love New York and I see myself as a Knick for a long, long time,” Porzingis said.

“I don't think they should be worried about it.""

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

In fact, it’s one of the most beautiful aspects of the American spirit. But with every new national tragedy, it seems that unifying spirit is a little weaker than before.

On Sunday morning, tragedy struck our great country once again. A gunman opened fire in a place of worship killing at least 26 people and wounding 20 in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Even more heartbreaking, eight of the 26 victims were members of the same family. Yet somehow, as our country mourns the loss of innocent life, there’s a new wave of indignation directed at people who dare to pray for the victims.

That’s right. As well-intentioned Americans pray for their countrymen who were just gunned down while worshipping God, gun control advocates are bashing them for their expression of faith. Here are just a few examples from my Twitter feed:

Consider this from Keith Olbermann:

Or, this profane statement from Star Trek actor Wil Wheaton:

It’s one thing to hold strong opinions about gun control. But it’s entirely different to direct anger towards people of faith after such a horrific tragedy. Just because you might not believe in prayer, doesn’t give you the right to publicly insult those who do.

In some ways, this outrage against prayer is emblematic of national trends. As America grows increasingly hostile to Christianity, inappropriate and insensitive rhetoric regarding expressions of faith has become more acceptable. It seems the same people who pride themselves on advocating religious and cultural “tolerance” are the least tolerant when it comes to American Christians.

Prayer has been a staple of the American experience since the founding of our nation. It’s why George Washington “fervently beseech[ed] the Almighty” in his farewell address. It’s why Abraham Lincoln constantly invoked the name of God in our nation’s darkest moments. It’s why every session of Congress still opens in prayer.

Prayer is a unifying force, especially in a country entrenched in political polarization. It’s a way of humbly admitting that as mere humans, we do not have all the answers. Prayer is an expression of hope that someday all of the world’s evils will come to an end.

No matter how great gun control advocates think their policies may be, you can’t legislate evil away. Certainly, it’s important that policymakers engage in productive dialogue about methods to help mitigate future violence. But the most perfect legislation (if one ever existed), still leaves our country in need of the Almighty.

As long as there is evil in this world, Americans should continue to exercise their right to pray for a brighter day. This is—no doubt—a troubling time for our nation. But it’s times like these that often bring forth the best that our nation has to offer. Slandering the faithful among us isn’t the path to a unified, peaceful America.

He was convicted on two charges of domestic assault, served 12 months in confinement at the Naval Consolidated Brig in California, and was later given the bad conduct discharge.","Air Force Didn't Report Texas Shooter's Domestic-Violence Conviction to Federal Database, Allowing Him to Buy Guns",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/air-force-didnt-report-texas-shooters-domestic-violence-conviction-federal-database

The last American woman to win New York was Miki Gorman, who won consecutive titles in 1976-77.

Flanagan cried and yelled as she approached the finish line all alone.

""It's indescribable,"" the 36-year-old Flanagan said. ""It's a moment I'm trying to soak up and savor.""

NEW YORK CITY MARATHON FEATURES MASSIVE SECURITY EFFORT AFTER DEADLY TRUCK ATTACK

Flanagan finished second in New York in her first marathon in 2010 but hadn't run this race since. After a fracture in her lower back kept her out of the Boston Marathon, Flanagan trained hard for New York with an eye on Keitany.

Flanagan called Keitany ""the alpha racer"" and said she was ready to ""suffer dearly"" while keeping up with the unpredictable runner.

On the podium, Flanagan put her hands over face and began to cry again when she was announced the winner. She turned to hug Keitany before accepting her medal.

""This is the moment I've dreamed off since I was a little girl,"" Flanagan said.

Flanagan had said she may retire if she won New York. She didn't immediately make an announcement regarding her future.

For the men's competition, Geoffrey Kamworor of Kenya held off countryman Wilson Kipsang by three seconds for his first major victory at the marathon.

Kamworor ran the race in 2 hours, 10 minutes, 53 seconds. He and Kipsang embraced just past the finish line to huge cheers.

The race on Sunday took place just days after a truck attack in Lower Manhattan killed eight people, and took place under the watchful eye of an extremely heavy police presence.

In Brooklyn, where runners made their way down a long stretch, roads were blocked and officers lined the street. As the runners went by, they were accompanied by an escort of police vehicles.

Those cheering the runners on say the increased security presence was noted, but didn't dim the experience.

Karen Hester has been coming to watch the race for 10 years and told the Associated PRess she was ""not in the slightest"" bit concerned about being in a crowded space or the threat of a terror attack.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was expecting 2 million fans to line the course.

""New York City said strongly we're not giving into terrorists,"" de Blasio said, adding ""That's a message we're sending the whole world.""

Comedian Kevin Hart made his marathon debut at New York. Forget about chasing gold — the actor and fitness nut was mostly worried about avoiding humiliation.

""I don't want to see a bunch of memes of me looking weird out here,"" Hart said shortly before starting.

Court papers filed Friday say about $1.65 million would go upfront to the widow and daughter of Jason Simcakoski, of Stevens Point, Wis., who was 35 when he died in 2014 at the Tomah VA facility. Another $659,000 would go into annuities for Simcakoski's widow, Heather, and their daughter, Anaya. The rest would go to attorney fees and expenses.



The Wisconsin State Journal reported Saturday that a federal judge will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to approve the settlement.



Simcakoski's death led to the firing of the Tomah VA's chief of staff, Dr. David Houlihan, who agreed this past January to surrender his medical license permanently. The former head of the center, Mario DeSanctis, was fired in 2015 but fought his dismissal and eventually was allowed to resign, USA Today reported earlier this month. He and his lawyer were paid $163,000, it said.

Simcakoski, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2002, had been treated from 2006 to 2014 for a variety of conditions. He was admitted to the Tomah VA's acute psychiatric unit on Aug. 10, 2014, then transferred to a short stay unit.



On the morning of Aug. 30, 2014, he was so sedated he could barely speak, his family alleged in the lawsuit. He was found unresponsive that afternoon. He died after life-saving attempts were made, although they weren't started for about 10 minutes after he was found.



An autopsy determined that Simcakoski died from mixed drug toxicity. The inspector general found that doctors who prescribed his medications failed to talk with him about the risks, and noted delays in the start of CPR and the lack of medication at the Tomah VA to reverse drug overdoses.

Briskman's face was not visible in the photo, but she claimed she immediately confessed her involvement to her employer the Monday after the photo went viral.

Briskman said she was then promptly fired on Tuesday from the government contracting firm and escorted out of the building for violating the ""code of conduct policy.""

“They said, ‘We’re separating from you,‘” Briskman told the Huffington Post. “Basically, you cannot have ‘lewd’ or ‘obscene’ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off ‘obscene.’”

Briskman, who claimed she was fired because her employer was worried about losing government contracts, said she has contacted the American Civil Liberties Union. She insisted she would flip off the president again if given the chance.

Stephen Willeford, 55, said he was at his Sutherland Springs home Sunday when his daughter alerted him that she'd heard gunfire at the First Baptist Church nearby. Willeford said he immediately retrieved his rifle from his weapon safe.

""I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots — just 'Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!' — and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren't just random shots,"" Willeford said Monday during an interview with television stations KHBS/KHOG in Fort Smith and Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Willeford said he loaded his magazine and ran barefoot across the street to the church where he saw gunman Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, and exchanged gunfire.

""He saw me and I saw him,"" Willeford said. ""I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover. I know I hit him. He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.""

As Kelley sped away, Willeford said he ran to a pickup truck stopped an intersection and told the driver, ""That guy just shot up the Baptist church. We need to stop him.""

The driver, Johnnie Langendorff, said he had been driving to Sutherland Springs on Sunday to pick up his girlfriend when a man who'd been exchanging gunfire with Kelley suddenly landed inside his truck.

""He jumped in my truck and said, 'He just shot up the church, we need to go get him.' And I said, 'Let's go,'"" Langendorff, a 27-year-old Seguin resident, told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that the ensuing pursuit eventually clocked speeds upwards of 90 mph (145 kph).

Willeford said he and Langendorrf kept a 911 operator advised as the high-speed pursuit continued. He said Kelley ultimately hit a road sign and flipped his vehicle into a roadside ditch.

Willeford said he then exited Langendorrf's pickup, perched his rifle on the rooftop and trained it on Kelley's vehicle. He then yelled: ""Get out of the truck! Get out of the truck!"" But Kelley did not move.

Langendorff said police arrived about five minutes later. Based on evidence at the scene, investigators believe Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""There was no thinking about it,"" Langendorff said. ""There was just doing. That was the key to all this. Act now. Ask questions later.""

Asked if he felt like a hero, Langendorff said: ""I don't really know how I feel. I just hope that the families and people affected by this can sleep easier knowing that this man is not breathing anymore and not able to hurt anyone else. I feel I just did what was right.""

Though he did not identify Willeford by name, Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said at a news conference Monday that the armed resident who confronted Kelley was toting an ""AR assault rifle and engaged"" the shooter.

Martin later praised Willeford and Langendorff: ""The number one goal of law enforcement is to neutralize the shooter. In this situation, we had two good Samaritans who did that for law enforcement.""

Julius Kepper, Willeford's next-door neighbor for the past seven years, described Willeford as a gun and motorcycle enthusiast who regularly takes target practice at property out in the country, and has as many as five Harley Davidson motorcycles.

""Avid gun collector, a good guy,"" Kepper said.

Kepper and other neighbors said Willeford's family has been in the Sutherland Springs area for at least three generations, including a father and grandfather who were in dairy farming. Stephen Willeford is married with two grown children and works as a plumber who installs lines on major projects such as hospitals, Kepper said.

He called Willeford a ""free spirit"" sort who loves motorcycles despite losing both parents to a motorcycle crash when he was a young adult. ""It was almost the same spot where they ran (the shooter) off the road,"" Kepper said.

Kepper said he's not surprised Willeford would exchange gunfire with the church gunman. Others in the neighborhood would have done the same if they knew what was happening, he said.

""Just like everybody else around here. He was just the first one there,"" Kepper said.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday praised Willeford's actions, after talking to law enforcement officials and visiting the church in Sutherland Springs. He lauded the ""ordinary citizen"" who engaged the gunman.

""One individual demonstrated bravery and courage. We need to be celebrating that bravery and courage,"" Cruz said.

Still, Willeford proved a reluctant hero.

""I didn't want this and I want the focus to be on my friends,"" Willeford told The Dallas Morning News for a story published Monday that also confirmed he was the first person to confront Kelley. ""I have friends in that church. I was terrified while this was going on.""

No one answered the door at the Willeford residence Monday. Food that had been delivered to the house was stacked up on the front porch.

Humans of New York is a page dedicated to photos and stories from New Yorkers. One subject – an anonymous male in the city – was quoted confessing his honest feelings about his relationship.

“We had excellent dates. Everything else about her was exactly what I wanted. I didn’t want to ruin something good for that one little reason,” he says.

FITNESS TRAINER RESPONDS TO FAT-SHAMING AFTER USA TODAY SEGMENT

But that “one little reason” has stirred a controversy on the post, which has amassed over 30,000 comments and nearly 1,500 shares.

“At first I told myself I could get past it. I said, ‘Let’s just see how it goes,’” the post reads before he goes on to confess, “But it’s been 1.5 years. And I feel horrible, but I just can’t get past it.”

“And I feel like a bad person for being bothered by it. I can’t bring myself to tell her. We’re going to couple’s therapy next week, but I still don’t think I’ll be able to say it. Is there any right way to ask someone to lose weight for you?” it concludes.

The majority of people on Facebook have agreed that there isn’t a right way to ask.

One person wrote on Twitter, “If a man can’t love a woman when she’s overweight, he doesn’t deserve to love her if she ever decides to lose weight on her own.”

“The guy simply has to accept he is not physically attracted to her and move on. Happens to everyone to compromise and realize it doesn’t work,” one person tweeted.

Another person posted on the Facebook page, “No. You are the one with the problem, not her. Do her a favour and end it.”

While some comments were more aggressive, with one person saying, “That is a terrible human being,” they all pretty much said the same thing – the man should end the relationship.

But there were at least a couple of defenders, with one tweeting, “How is this shallow? He obviously loves her, and wants her to be attractive. Dont[sic] we all want our partner to be attractive?”

Evil seems unavoidable -- even in church.

On Sunday, November 5, 2017, America witnessed the deadliest church shooting in her history. The gunman walked into a house of worship outside San Antonio, Texas and opened fire on members of the congregation.

Is God the author of evil? It is the question that challenges all of us during times of unexplained evil acts. If not God, how then do we explain evil?

Without debate, it was a gunman who perpetrated the evil in San Antonio. So it's man and not God? Which brings me to the next question, ""Why didn't God make better creatures?”

No one seems to want to recognize the existence of an evil being, only evil acts.

The act didn't just happen; the law of causality teaches us that every event has a cause.

Investigators will spend countless hours trying to understand the motive behind the murder. In the end, the conclusion will be similar to other investigations. The shooter will be found to be unstable, using anti-depressants or inconclusive.

No one seems to want to recognize the existence of an evil being, only evil acts.

The reason that immoral acts bother us and get our attention is that we are moral creatures who know the difference between good and evil.

Jesus made a shocking statement about Judas, the one who betrayed him, ""it would be better for him if he had not been born.""

It's shocking on to think Jesus would make such a statement and equally shocking that Jesus, knowing the world would be better without Judas, allowed Judas to remain.

What is there about good and evil that we don't understand? Is it necessary for both to co-exist, at least for a season? Does evil cause us to strive for good and in our striving permit us to find good? Does God permit evil in this world as a way to produce the best in us? That seems like God is using an illegitimate ""end justifies the means"" ethic.

There is something about evil that drives us to God. Atheist Jean-Paul Sartre said, ""I needed God...I reached out for religion; I longed for it, it was the remedy. Had it been denied me, I would have invented it for myself.”

As a pastor, I struggle to explain the ""why"" behind the senseless evil acts that we witness as human beings. Simple answers to complex questions are bound to be wrong.

So what am I to do? I can give the pat answers that weary all of us, or I can admit my struggle, confront evil and seek to extend the love of God in both good and bad times.","Texas church shooting: God, evil and a senseless act",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/texas-church-shooting-god-evil-and-senseless-act.html

FOX NEWS POLL: VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE REMAINS TIGHT“They’ve known they’re in a close race for some time.","Democrats have worked feverishly all year to make nearly every local election a referendum on President Trump – and Tuesday's gubernatorial races are no exception.

The Trump factor looms large in the marquee Virginia gubernatorial race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and his allies have churned out mailers and ads tying Republican rival Ed Gillespie to the Trump White House at every turn.

The Trump-referendum strategy has not been particularly successful for Democrats in the House special elections so far this year. But this time, polls in New Jersey and Virginia’s gubernatorial races show the Democratic candidates in the lead.

In New Jersey, Democratic nominee Phil Murphy holds a substantial lead over Republican Kim Guadagno.

But the race in Virginia is considerably tighter. According to the latest Fox News Poll released Monday, Northam holds a 5-point edge over Gillespie, who says there is “no doubt” the polls are close.

In the final stretch, Gillespie questioned whether the Democrats' Trump-all-the-time strategy is a sound one.

FOX NEWS POLL: VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE REMAINS TIGHT

“They’ve known they’re in a close race for some time. They’ve been throwing the kitchen sink at us with awful and vile ads,” Gillespie said on Fox News’ “Daily Briefing” Monday.

The most controversial of those ads was run by a Democratic group, Latino Victory Fund. It showed minority children seemingly being chased by a driver in a pickup truck, decked out with a Confederate flag and a “Gillespie for governor” bumper sticker. The ad concluded with a scene of a Charlottesville-like rally, with a narrator asking: “Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the ‘American Dream?’”

The ad was removed after extensive backlash.

ELECTION DAY 2017: FULL COVERAGE

Other mailers boast that Northam is ""standing up to Trump and Gillespie's politics of fear and hate.""

It's a message the campaign stands by as polls open.

“Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history,” Northam campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement to Fox News. “It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.”

Northam has campaigned with Democratic power players like former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden and even had a fundraiser headlined by Hillary Clinton.

WHO ARE ED GILLESPIE AND RALPH NORTHAM?

Meanwhile, Gillespie has garnered Republican support, with a fundraiser hosted by former President George W. Bush. He was joined by Vice President Pence on the campaign trail—but not Trump. Trump, though, has repeatedly expressed his support for Gillespie on Twitter.

""The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!"" Trump tweeted Monday.

Despite Democrats' claims, Gillespie seems to be keeping a certain distance from Trump, while telling Fox News that he would work with “President Trump and Vice President Pence and the Cabinet.” He listed priorities for Virginia, like “building more ships” and “keeping Norfolk the largest base in the world.”

“In terms of working with the president and vice president, any governor of Virginia has to be able to work with the president of the United States,” Gillespie said Monday. “That’s always been our history given our proximity. I’ll be able to.”

In New Jersey, Lt. Gov. Guadagno is dealing not only with attempts to link her to Trump but to outgoing and controversial Gov. Chris Christie.

Murphy, a multimillionaire former Goldman Sachs executive and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, said the choice for New Jersey’s next governor couldn’t be clearer.

“On the one hand more of the same, another Chris Christie four years of failed politics, of failed politices for the middle class that was hollowed out and ravaged, where public education doesn’t get funded, infrastructure is ignored, we become more unfair by the day and we are caught in this awful us vs. them vortex,” Murphy said at a recent campaign event. “Or we can turn the page and change.”

Guadagno’s response? She reminds voters that Christie is no longer on the ballot.

Murphy, like Northam, also has welcomed big names on the campaign trail, with former Presidents Obama and Bill Clinton, and Biden, at campaign events.

There is much at stake in both gubernatorial elections, but whoever takes the governor’s mansion in New Jersey could have the added responsibility of appointing a senator—if Sen. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., is convicted in his corruption trial and resigns.

Menendez maintains his innocence. But if he were to step down, the appointment decision would have serious implications for Trump's policy agenda in a closely divided Senate.

“With the Senate so evenly divided, the outcome of the New Jersey gubernatorial election, if Senator Menendez were to be convicted, could determine the Trump agenda and if it would move forward with greater ease in the Senate,"" said Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University.

Another race to watch Tuesday is in Utah, with the election to fill the House seat previously held by Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz who resigned from his post in June.

President Trump is in Seoul, the second stop on his five-nation, 11-day Asian tour and the mutual compliments were flowing.
Their angst was directed at President Trump.
South Korea’s defense minister raised these issues in his recent meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, South Korean officials said.
In his speech last week, President Moon said the use of force against Pyongyang ""shall not be taken” absent South Korean consent.","Who most worries South Korea’s President Moon Jae In? Is it North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, the brutal dictator who has vowed to oust U.S. forces from the Korean peninsula and reunify north and south under his authoritarian leadership, or America’s democratically elected, Twitter-happy president Donald J. Trump? That is not an easy question to answer.

President Trump is in Seoul, the second stop on his five-nation, 11-day Asian tour and the mutual compliments were flowing. But while South Koreans enjoy a prosperous democracy with strong economic growth, an unfettered press and vibrant political debate, many Koreans are reluctant to distress visitors by telling us things we might prefer not to hear or consider insulting.

Diplomatic niceties notwithstanding, President Moon’s advisers at the presidential “Blue House” in Seoul left little doubt during my visit two weeks ago about whom they regard as the tougher customer to handle.

Their angst was directed at President Trump. “Is he crazy enough to attempt a pre-emptive strike?” one adviser to President Moon asked me during my week-long stay in the Korean capital. “Kim Jung Un is not irrational,” the adviser asserted. But could President Trump’s brash rhetoric and inexperience in foreign affairs “provoke an accidental, unintended conflict?”

The left-leaning President Moon finds himself in a tough diplomatic spot. Although the South Korean-U.S. alliance forged in 1953 in the aftermath of the Korean War has long been the pillar of South Korea’s security and a guarantee against North Korean aggression, Moon took office this year promising to revive a long-stalled dialogue with North Korea and “say no to the Americans if necessary.” But given Kim Jung Un’s lack of response to his overtures, President Moon has had little choice but to stand with President Trump, despite concerns that his bellicose rhetoric could drag Korea into a war that it neither chooses nor desires.

Although his approval ratings remain high, Moon’s reluctant embrace of Mr. Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy towards Pyongyang has alienated part of his own political base and left him vulnerable to charges of selling out to Washington.

Still, in a nationally televised speech last week, Moon did not offer to meet with his North Korean counterpart, a staple of his earlier speeches. While he strongly opposed military action in response to North Korea’s ongoing nuclear program, he endorsed the largest annual increase in South Korea’s military budget in nearly a decade and vowed to maintain his country’s “overwhelming military superiority.” Specifically, his annual budget, which legislators must approve, calls for almost a 7 percent increase in defense spending and a 10.5 percent increase in funds for projects aimed at “enhancing defense capabilities.”

Increasingly boxed in not only by Kim Jung Un’s unwillingness to engage and President Trump’s demands for greater support for a tougher stance towards North Korea and more trade concessions from his country, Moon has reached out to China.

Last Tuesday, he and China reached agreement to end their dispute over Beijing’s opposition to Seoul’s deployment of the U.S. defense system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD.

To prevent Seoul from expanding the system, China has punished South Korean businesses, particularly those in the tourism, cosmetics and entertainment sectors. Although China did not specifically link its boycott of such companies to THAAD deployment, Beijing has made its opposition to the system clear.

As part of its renewed outreach, President Moon is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a separate meeting during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam on Nov. 10th and 11th. Several Korean analysts predicted that Moon would continue to move closer to Beijing as concerns about perceived dysfunction in Washington grows. “President Moon is very pro-Chinese,” said Kim Jin-Hyun, chairman of the World Peace Forum.

South Korean officials said that another item on the agenda of the Moon-Trump talks will be South Korea’s stated desire for greater control of its own military forces in the event of war and an effective veto over American military action against North Korea without Seoul’s consent.

South Korea’s defense minister raised these issues in his recent meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, South Korean officials said. Since the 1950’s, Korean forces are supposed to be under U.S. command in the event of conflict. In his speech last week, President Moon said the use of force against Pyongyang ""shall not be taken” absent South Korean consent.

As a practical matter, however, there is little that Moon can do in the short run about his junior status in the U.S.-Korean alliance given Kim Jung Un’s continued testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, his lack of interest in dialogue and the presence of nearly 11,000 conventional artillery pieces aimed at Seoul just north of the demilitarized zone, the infamous DMZ. South Korean officials concede that a conflict with the North might erupt quickly, without much time for consultation. “There is no hotline between Pyongyang and Seoul,” one official acknowledged.

South Korean officials breathed a collective sigh of relief when they learned that President Trump had no plans to visit the DMZ which divides the two Koreas, on his first trip to their country. Though virtually all recent American commanders in chief have made this stop on a presidential visit, U.S. officials said that Mr. Trump would be too busy addressing the National Assembly, South Korea’s legislature, the first U.S. leader to do so in almost 25 years.

Mr. Trump also visited Camp Humphreys at Pyeongtaek Tuesday, south of Seoul, the site to which many of the 28,500 American soldiers stationed in Korea are being relocated, largely at South Korea’s expense.Though he praised Koreans for spending billions on the new base the president quipped that he could have built it for less.",Judith Miller: Who worries Korea's leader the most -- Trump or Kim?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/judith-miller-who-worries-koreas-leader-most-trump-or-kim.html

By William McGurn, The Wall Street Journal



Imagine you are a sane Democrat who recognizes that a big reason Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in November was that she alienated many members of the white working class. In the year since, you have been working on your fellow Democrats to change their message in hopes of wooing these voters back into the fold. Then a gunman opens fire at a Baptist church in Texas, and suddenly progressives are in full deplorable mode, attacking anyone who dares offer . . . prayers.

This is the extraordinary turn of events since Devin Patrick Kelley turned his rifle on the innocent churchgoers inside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. What provoked the left, if it can really be called a provocation, was President Trump’s statement from Japan Sunday, in which he said that “our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of today’s horrible and murderous attack.” House Speaker Paul Ryan likewise set off the furies by tweeting, “The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now.”

The responses have to be read to be believed. Here’s one of the more charming: “The murdered victims were in a church,” tweeted actor Wil Wheaton to Mr. Ryan. “If prayers did anything, they’d still be alive, you worthless sack of [expletive].”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren chose less inflammatory wording for her own tweet. “Thoughts & prayers are not enough, GOP,” wrote the Massachusetts Democrat. “We must end this violence. We must stop these tragedies. People are dying while you wait.” In short, if you are a Republican praying instead of passing gun control, you’ve got blood on your hands.

The Huffington Post devoted an entire piece to the phenomenon, under the headline “People Fed Up With ‘Thoughts and Prayers’ Demand Action After Texas Church Massacre.” It featured tweets from celebrities and gun-control advocates who believe they had discovered something big: Prayers aren’t always answered.",OPINION: How Dare the GOP Pray for Texas,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/opinion-how-dare-gop-pray-texas

Douglas County is a very Republican county.
Chris Schor, a former elementary school principal running on the CommUnity slate, didn't go into detail about the division.","Parents, kids and schools across the nation could feel the impact of the results from one Colorado school board election today, depending on the winners.

At issue: Private school vouchers, and whether the courts deems them constitutional.

In 2011, the conservative Douglas County School Board attempted to implement a voucher program to provide money to some students to attend private or religious schools of their choosing, regardless of their family's income or whether the new school was located outside the county they live in. A legal challenge over taxpayer dollars being used for religious purposes went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was kicked back to Colorado courts, which prevented it from ever getting off the ground.

Depending on Tuesday’s Election Day results, that could change.

Eight people are running to fill the four open seats on the Douglas County School Board. The race has generated a political storm in Colorado's third largest school district, inside one of the nation’s wealthiest counties.

That's because if the balance shifts, by even one seat, the results could have a major impact on the pro-school-choice movement vocally endorsed by President Trump and his Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos. More than $500,000 has been poured in by outside interests on both sides, including the nation’s second-largest teachers union and traditional Republican donors – with deep pockets.

""I don't think politics should be involved. No way,"" says Shaylee Holland, a mother of three, and supporter of the “school choice” slate of candidates. That slate, which calls itself “Elevate Douglas County” is made up of four conservative Republicans who say they believe the voucher issue should play out in the courts and, if deemed constitutional, be put to the community.

""It's the reality of America today,"" says commercial real estate developer Grant Nelson, one of the candidates on the Elevate slate. “Everything is polarized. School board elections didn't use to be polarized but now they are, and it is big money that changes how things work.""

Colorado political analyst Eric Sondermann said he isn't surprised the race has gotten so nasty and that it is attracting big money. Even in a county where registered Republican voters outnumber Democrats two-to-one, the battle lines are all over the place, he said. And it’s triggered Republican infighting.

""It has partisan overtones but no, it is not purely partisan. Douglas County is a very Republican county. Yes, there are Democrats and unaffiliated voters down there, but the heart and soul of Douglas County is Republican,” Sondermann said. “To a very large extent, it's Republicans fighting with other Republicans""

Flyers, attack ads and even vehicles hand-painted with support for one side have prompted finger-pointing from both sides that the other side is making this a hurtful race.

Chris Schor, a former elementary school principal running on the CommUnity slate, didn't go into detail about the division. But she said she altered the hand-paint on her car after a road rage incident she encountered. Her side of the ballot would let the voucher idea die.

""So, for me personally, I could tell you I have one vote, to vote for public education,” she said. “Public funds for public education.""

Beth Kerr, a mother and vehement supporter of the CommUnity slate, is also a Republican. She said she feels her party isn't listening to its members. She is also tired of the national attention.

""I think it's sad,"" Kerr said. “I would love for our district to be our district and our community focus on our families and our community and our students. And not look at what the outside interest is or being the best in the nation. I think it needs to be what's best for our kids here.""

On the other side, Shaylee Holland is also frustrated. Frustrated that things have gotten this bad.

""No matter what you think about the vouchers, it should have never gotten to this level,” Holland said. “But the bottom line is it does need to be decided once and for all.""

Most parents Fox News spoke to agree that what’s getting lost in the fight is how the students are impacted by the actions of adults.

""As it gets kicked up the line, to national interests, national implications,” Sondermann said, “kids are probably not as central to the debate as they are for average voters that are actually going to decide this.""",Colorado race could have major impact on future of private school voucher programs,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/07/colorado-race-could-have-major-impact-on-future-private-school-voucher-programs.html

“After I told him I was trans, he told me he was gay,” Andersen told us.
The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO.
However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.
A former female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members.","A day after a former country singer told Fox News Nashville’s superpublicist Kirt Webster had sexually assaulted and drugged him – a charge Webster denies – a former intern has come forward with claims that he, too, was sexually harassed by the PR powerhouse.

Cody Andersen, 33, told Fox News he was thrilled to be accepted in 2010 as an intern at Webster PR, a firm that boasted Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels and Kenny Rogers among its clients. And when Webster, the firm’s CEO, started taking an interest in him, Andersen said he thought it was because of his work ethic.

“Everything was fine for a while,” Andersen told Fox News in an interview Wednesday. But when the then-intern revealed he was transgender, things started to become “uncomfortable” with Webster.

“After I told him I was trans, he told me he was gay,” Andersen told us. “And one day he followed me [into] the bathroom and he was like, ‘Do you want to?’ I was like, ‘What?’ He said, ‘F--k.’ And I was like, ‘No, no.’”

“I was really taken aback by it…” Andersen said.

Harvey Weinstein scandal: What you need to know

Andersen alleged Webster would speak openly about a number of sexually graphic topics, like owning a 24-carat gold sex toy. He also said Webster often told sexually explicit stories about his employees.

Andersen alleges that Webster once asked him to come into a hot tub, naked. That prompted Andersen to alert the Webster company human resources office — several times.

“[My complaint] didn’t go anywhere,” Andersen said. “To get out of Kirt Webster’s grasp once he brings you in, it's hard to get away from him… He’s a predator.”

Andersen said he told his family about the ongoing harassment. A family member spoke to Fox News who recalled hearing about Webster’s alleged behavior in detail at the time, back when Andersen was 26.

Andersen’s claims came a day after former singer Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

Through his company, Webster denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying he engaged in a consensual relationship with Rick. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

When reached by email about Andersen’s allegation, a rep for Webster said she had no additional information at this time.

Rick and Andersen’s stories are two of “many,” according to five former employees who spoke to Fox News this week. They detailed instances where they say Webster showed them porn, made lewd gestures in the office and mocked clients during staff meetings.

A former employee previously known to Fox News, who wished to remain anonymous, said Webster touched him inappropriately on “multiple occasions” adding there are “so many” stories similar to his.

“There’s no telling how many there are,” he said. “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.” A close friend told Fox News the former employee discussed Webster’s behavior in detail many times with him.

A former female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions. She also alleged Webster made comments about her vagina in front of clients. Her roommate at the time told Fox News the former employee told her they discussed Webster’s behavior at length, and the roommate met Webster several times and witnessed his “lewd behavior.”

Another female former employee told us Webster was “verbally abusive” and told her he was going to “cut my [clitoris].’”

“He scares you. He makes you think you’ll never work in country music again,” she said. Her boyfriend at the time told Fox News he often urged her to leave Webster after hearing about her then-boss’ behavior.

A fourth former employee told Fox News he was hired after graduating from college, and was asked to bring things to Webster at his home, where he encountered his then-boss watching porn.

“One time he was just sitting in a towel on his couch watching porn. He invited me into his hot tub, and when I told him I didn’t have a swimsuit, he implied I could come in naked.”

A fifth former employee told Fox News working for Webster was “the worst experience"" of his life.

“Everybody in Nashville knows Kirt Webster and knows he's a horrible person,” he said.

Reviews on the site Glassdoor, a platform for people to anonymously share information about companies, mimic the sentiments former Webster employees shared with Fox News.

“[Webster] runs his business using fear, intimidation, and harassment,” one reviewer from October 15 wrote. “I am not exaggerating in my accusation of Webster PR as a hostile work environment where employees are subject to sexual harassment, sudden and inappropriate anger outbursts.”

Representatives for Webster himself, or for the company, did not respond to numerous requests for comment.","Country music's top publicist accused of propositioning intern for sex, showing employees porn",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/02/country-musics-top-publicist-accused-propositioning-intern-for-sex.html

The Research Association of Vision of North Korea interviewed 21 North Korean defectors who lived in Kilju, a nearby town north of the Punngye-ri nuclear test site where six tests have been conducted, and said babies were reportedly being born with birth defects and residents feared radiation contamination because of the high mortality rate for any form of life, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported.

“I personally saw corpses floating down the river with their limbs severed."" - North Korean defector

""I heard from a relative in Kilju that deformed babies were born in hospitals there,” one defector said, according to the newspaper.

Another added: ""I spoke on the phone with family members I left behind there and they told me that all of the underground wells dried up after the sixth nuclear test.""

GRAPHIC PICTURE WARNING:

The defectors said drinking water in the town streamed down from Mount Montap, where the nuclear tests were reportedly conducted underground. They added authorities left residents in the area to fend for themselves and provided no warning prior to the detonations or protections after. A defector who fled North Korea in 2010 recalled how only soldiers and their family members were evacuated before two tests were conducted.

""During the first nuclear test [October 2006] and second one [May 2009], only family members of soldiers were evacuated to underground shafts. Ordinary people were completely unaware of the tests,” the defector recalled.

“I personally saw corpses floating down the river with their limbs severed,” the defector said, adding that local residents were also ordered to dig “deep holes for those tests.”

The defectors claimed all forms of life struggled to stay alive. About 80 percent of trees that were planted on the mountains died off, and trout and pine mushrooms just “disappeared” from the region when the first nuclear test was conducted in 2006.

""If you plant trees in the mountains there, 80 percent of them die. You can blame it on poor planting, but the number of trees that die is higher than in other mountains,” a defector said.

The defector accounts by Chosun Ilbo were not verified by North Korean officials, but the former North Korean residents claimed Kim Jong Un’s regime made sure none of the local residents were able to tell their stories.

One person recalled, ""Kilju locals who made appointments in a large hospital in Pyongyang were not allowed to enter the capital after the sixth nuclear test.""

""People who boarded trains to the border with samples of soil, water and leaves from Kilju County were arrested and sent to prison camps,” another defector said.

North Korea has slammed recent reports surrounding the Punngye-ri test site, calling a Japanese television’s claim that at least 200 people died when tunnels collapsed underground as “misinformation.” The report by Asahi TV, citing a North Korean source, stated hundreds were trapped and killed while doing underground construction on the tunnel last month. Scientists believe the site was destabilized after the sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, when a purported hydrogen bomb was detonated. Satellite images obtained by 38 North, which specialized in North Korean issues, also showed a possible “collapsed chimney crater” at Mount Mantap.

Radiation leaking and drifting across the Sea of Japan and to the Japanese islands has also been a concern. Dr. Joel Myers, the founder and chairman of AccuWeather, said lingering radiation from the sixth nuclear test could threaten other countries. North Korean officials' hope to contain the radiation leakage within the Hermit Kingdom could change as winds pick up out of the northwest, according to Myers.

Democrats have worked feverishly all year to make nearly every local election a referendum on President Trump – and Tuesday's gubernatorial races are no exception.

The Trump factor looms large in the marquee Virginia gubernatorial race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and his allies have churned out mailers and ads tying Republican rival Ed Gillespie to the Trump White House at every turn.

The Trump-referendum strategy has not been particularly successful for Democrats in the House special elections so far this year. But this time, polls in New Jersey and Virginia’s gubernatorial races show the Democratic candidates in the lead.

In New Jersey, Democratic nominee Phil Murphy holds a substantial lead over Republican Kim Guadagno.

But the race in Virginia is considerably tighter. According to the latest Fox News Poll released Monday, Northam holds a 5-point edge over Gillespie, who says there is “no doubt” the polls are close.

In the final stretch, Gillespie questioned whether the Democrats' Trump-all-the-time strategy is a sound one.","Election Day: Trump Factor Looms Large in Virginia, New Jersey Governor's Races",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/election-day-trump-factor-looms-large-virginia-new-jersey-governors-races

The new regulations were designed to avoid questions about the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas and other political topics.

The statement comes following a backlash by artists, including from the co-host for the awards show, Brad Paisley.

""I'm sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines. In 3...2....1.....,"" Paisley tweeted Friday.

After the decision was reversed Paisley tweeted, ""Bravo CMA awards for doing the right thing & apologizing for this mistake. All are welcome, let's have a great show.""

The CMA's original statement was as follows:

“In light of recent events, and out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved, please refrain from focusing your coverage of the CMA Awards Red Carpet and Backstage Media Center on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like,” read the guidelines provided to Fox News.

“It’s vital, more so this year than in years past due to the sensitivities at hand, that the CMA Awards be a celebration of Country Music and the artists that make this genre so great. It’s an evening to honor the outstanding achievements in Country Music of the previous year and we want everyone to feel comfortable talking to press about this exciting time.”

A representative for the CMAs noted to Fox News that “all outlets must agree for access” to the event. The 51st Annual CMA Awards are scheduled to take place in Nashville, Tennessee on November 8.

At a media preview Thursday in New York City, with hosts Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley, The Associated Press asked the performers about the Vegas shooting. The stars said they want to honor the victims’ families during the show.

The world of country music has been in unique and unfamiliar territory of late following the tragedy in Las Vegas at a Jason Aldean concert that left nearly 60 people dead. Additionally, one of the genre's most popular publicists, Kirt Webster, is embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.
